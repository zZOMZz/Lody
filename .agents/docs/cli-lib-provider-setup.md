# Durable provider setup

How the CLI creates a verified builtin agent config as durable, cancellable workspace
state instead of an in-memory wizard. Managed builtins use the queue to prepare their
runtime; Bub and Dimcode use it to verify their ACP process before publication.
[`apps/cli/src/lib/AGENTS.md`](../../apps/cli/src/lib/AGENTS.md) requires this page to
be read before `provider-setup-manager.ts` is changed, because the rules below bind it.

## Rows and ownership

`provider-setup-manager.ts` owns durable builtin creation for managed runtimes, Bub, and Dimcode. The
in-progress config lives in the machine Flock under `['providerSetup', configId]` while
runtime, auth, and live-probe work is incomplete, and only the target CLI may publish
it — by writing `agentConfig` and deleting `providerSetup` in one commit. Setup rows
with executable runtime overrides are invalid.

Only managed builtins enter binary status/download handling. Dimcode installs its
pinned npm package during the live npx probe; it has no managed-artifact phase.
Bub is user-installed, so
its queued setup advances directly to the live ACP probe. A missing or broken `bub`
command leaves a failed, retryable setup row and never publishes an `agentConfig`.
Missing-executable and missing-ACP-plugin signatures are classified as
`runtime-unavailable`, allowing the UI to offer the copyable Bub ACP preset installer;
other startup/protocol failures remain `verification-failed`.

Bub's configuration dialog can explicitly start this queue with Test and observe
its setup row in place, including installation guidance, retry, and deletion.
Successful publication returns the dialog to the form with Refresh and Save;
subsequent refreshes use the published config rather than queueing setup again.
Closing the dialog leaves the task in the provider list. See the
[Bub verification Spec](../../specs/bub-provider-verification.md).

Cancellation is a separate row, `['providerSetupCancellation', configId]`. After a
merge the owning CLI causally deletes any concurrently published setup or config, so a
cancellation that raced a publish still wins. Restart resumes only non-interactive
states.

## When the queue may start

In cloud or dual mode, queue processing starts only after the machine Flock's first
remote sync, so a stale local row cannot outrun a remote cancellation. The OSS local
platform has no remote transport at all: its opened SQLite-backed Flock is
authoritative, so existing rows are processed immediately and new local-data-plane rows
trigger the same queue. Never make local mode wait on `firstSyncedWithRemote`.

The durable command subscription that delivers these rows is described in
[`apps/cli/src/lib/loro/AGENTS.md`](../../apps/cli/src/lib/loro/AGENTS.md).

## Secrets

Never add authorization URLs, codes, tokens, or raw provider output to a setup row, and
never publish a row from caller-supplied auth RPC fields. A setup row is workspace
state that reaches every member's client.
