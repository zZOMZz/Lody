# Agent Notes

Notes are important decision records for human and agent contributors. Shared
maintenance and publication rules come from the [parent instructions](../AGENTS.md).

## When to write

Every non-trivial change MUST add or update an Agent Note in the same PR.
Non-trivial work changes behavior, architecture, cross-file or package contracts,
storage/wire/configuration formats, process/tooling, testing strategy, or another
decision a maintainer may reasonably revisit. A short diff is not an exemption.
Only mechanical or local edits that change none of these decisions or their
rationale need only a PR summary.

Research and design that produce a substantial proposal, a consequential finding,
or a correction to an earlier conclusion also require a note, even without code
changes or a PR. Record proposals as `proposed`; do not invent approval or completed
verification. If the task explicitly forbids file writes, report the intended note
and defer the write rather than overriding that restriction.

Search for the existing owning note first; updating it satisfies this requirement.
Use a new linked note for a different decision rather than duplicating the owner
or rewriting a historical decision into its opposite. Updating an affected Spec
is separate, even when no note is needed.

Record the problem, responsibilities, evidence-backed discoveries, genuine
alternatives, trade-offs, outcome, verification limits, and PR link when available.
Do not invent alternatives or PRs.

A note is not overflow space for an oversized `AGENTS.md`. Nothing makes an agent
read a dated note before changing a file, so a constraint that still binds stays
in the nearest `AGENTS.md` even when its rationale moves here; leave the one-line
rule in place and link the note. See
[where content goes](../README.md#where-content-goes).

## Opening abstract

After the title, metadata, and language link, start the body with `## Abstract`
(`## 摘要` in Chinese). Write one short, self-contained paragraph, usually three
to five sentences, like a paper abstract in plain language: the concrete problem
and its impact, the chosen or proposed approach, and the outcome or conclusion.
Include the most important trade-off or unresolved limit when it changes how the
reader should interpret the result. A proposal states what is proposed and what
remains unverified; never present expected benefits as measured results.

Readers should understand the decision without opening links or reading the rest.
Avoid file inventories, unexplained acronyms, chronology, and generic claims such
as "improves maintainability." Keep implementation evidence and detailed alternatives
in the body. Both language versions carry the same abstract meaning.

## Lifecycle and type

Paths are `{lifecycle}/{type}/yyyy-mm-dd-topic.md` with an adjacent `.zh.md`
counterpart; either language may be authored first. Create folders when a note
needs them, not a full matrix of empty directories.

The two axes are independent: lifecycle answers "what state is the decision in?";
type answers "what is the decision about?" Every lifecycle uses the same type set.
For example, a process proposal starts at `proposed/process/`; once adopted and
implemented, move its language pair to `implemented/process/`. Its type stays the same.
A runtime architecture proposal belongs in `proposed/architecture/` instead.

Lifecycle and the `Status:` line agree:

- `proposed/` + `Status: proposed`: pending decisions or work still under review.
- `implemented/` + `Status: implemented`: an adopted decision put into practice;
  name the evidence and remaining limits. This does not approve a linked Spec.
- `rejected/` + `Status: rejected`: explain why it was declined. Retain it while
  that reason can prevent a plausible mistake.
- `archived/` + `Status: implemented` and `Archived: YYYY-MM-DD`: historical
  implemented decisions no longer useful as active guidance. They are not current
  authority. Archive only implemented notes; obsolete proposals need a verdict.

Types:

| Folder           | Decision concerns                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `architecture`   | Module responsibilities, ownership, and communication     |
| `feature`        | Important new user or agent capability                    |
| `bug-fix`        | A defect exposing a consequential, non-obvious constraint |
| `simplification` | Removing complexity or capability and its trade-offs      |
| `process`        | Contributor workflows, tooling, and repository policy     |
| `testing`        | Verification strategy or test infrastructure              |

Pick the type of the decision, not every affected surface. Small fixes remain
exempt even though a bug-fix folder exists. A lifecycle move updates paths,
status, existing translations, and inbound links together.

## History and language

Translation follows the [shared language policy](../README.md#asynchronous-bilingual-documentation),
with one addition for agents. When the author is an Agent, land both `.md` and
`.zh.md` in the same change: cross-link the two languages, keep their `Status:`
equal, carry the same Abstract/摘要 meaning, and mark both `Translation: current`.
`Translation: pending` remains available only to a human who cannot write the
other language; an agent that can write both never merges a note as pending.

Implemented notes preserve the decision in its historical context. Current
behavior belongs in Specs; important later changes use a new linked note. Identify
factual corrections as corrections. Adding a note includes a scoped search for
related decisions: link partial replacements and archive obsolete implemented
records only when their rationale is no longer useful. Do not rewrite an old
choice into its opposite or silently remove rationale still constraining work.

Archived bodies are historical snapshots; use active documentation for current
facts and new linked records for corrections. Pending translations may be added
without rewriting the original history. Repository-wide link checks include archives;
repair broken link targets without changing the historical rationale. There is no
automated archive seal yet.
Do not add a global index or log that every contribution must modify. Search
proposed and implemented notes for current work; search archives explicitly for
historical questions, not as current authority.
