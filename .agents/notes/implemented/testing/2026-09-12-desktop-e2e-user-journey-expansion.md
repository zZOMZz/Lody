# Expand desktop E2E into five cross-feature matrices

## Abstract

Five P1 journeys now exercise feature matrices rather than isolated happy paths. Each matrix moves
the same user-owned state through multiple product surfaces, visible UI revisits, negative states,
cross-Session isolation, and UI cleanup. The journeys use visible controls in the built Electron
app, real IPC, the bundled CLI, and deterministic ACP providers. The attachment matrix also guards
a local-only defect where a cloud token incorrectly blocked the Electron file handoff. The active
registry contains 21 scenarios, and a Cucumber dry-run rejects ambiguous or undefined steps before
Electron starts.

## Decision

| Journey               | Interacting dimensions                                                                            | Negative and isolation proof                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LODY-SEARCH-001`     | Three titles, partial/case queries, rename reindex, UI revisit, Archive, delete                   | Empty results exclude every title; Archive/delete remove only the target while the similar result remains   |
| `LODY-ATTACHMENT-001` | Picker cancel, attachment plus prompt, plain follow-up, UI revisit, Archive restore, two Sessions | Cancel cannot submit; the next turn and second Session cannot inherit the attachment                        |
| `LODY-GOAL-001`       | Capability gating, two Sessions, Pause, update, Resume, UI revisit, Clear, Archive restore        | Invalid controls disappear; the independent Session has no goal snapshot or goal wire events                |
| `LODY-AGENT-001`      | Invalid draft, create, edit cancel, saved rename, two Providers, Settings revisit, two dispatches | Invalid/cancelled state cannot enter the catalog; each Session has distinct command and prompt evidence     |
| `LODY-CONTEXT-001`    | User/assistant prefixes, rich Markdown, UI revisit, Stop, completed request, two Sessions         | Prefixes exclude later turns and native fork targets; cancelled Session export excludes all primary history |

- Keep scenario-specific state beside each step module instead of extending the shared Cucumber
  World. Each journey uses a module-local `WeakMap`; fixtures own only synthetic provider signals
  and identifiers.
- Drive every product-state transition through visible controls, keyboard input, or the
  user-triggered file chooser. Fixtures simulate providers and record protocol evidence but do not
  mutate product state or release held turns. No matrix depends on sleeps, scheduler timing, live
  models, or network services.
- Treat nested menu dismissal as a user-visible state transition. The Agent Provider journey waits
  for both the run-configuration menu and Agent submenu to report their expanded state, dismisses
  each open menu level with `Escape`, and waits for the root trigger to report closed before the
  next click. It does not force clicks or dispatch selection through renderer internals.
- Treat local file handoff as independent of cloud authentication. A workspace is always required;
  an authentication token is required only after local transfer is unavailable or fails and the
  caller must use cloud upload.
- Run all feature bindings through Cucumber dry-run as part of `e2e:check`. This extends the suite
  contract beyond registry metadata and TypeScript so duplicated and missing phrases fail early.

This extends the [previous workflow expansion](2026-09-10-desktop-e2e-journey-expansion.md).
It restores existing local-only attachment intent and adds verification coverage, so no Spec
revision is required.

## Evidence and limits

The generated coverage and suite contract match 21 active scenarios to 21 unique IDs: four P0 and
17 P1. Static Cucumber resolution covers 223 steps. One combined real-Electron run passed all five
matrix journeys and their 94 steps in 59.290 seconds. The full serial regression passed all 21
scenarios and 223 steps in 199.995 seconds with no failures. Deterministic ACP providers prove local
product integration and protocol behavior without making external model or network availability a
merge condition.

Three macOS PR runs at heads `299d06f7`, `396b379c`, and `723237b2` exposed the Agent menu race. The
first correction made nested-menu opening and dismissal observable and passed three fresh focused
runs locally, but the next remote trace showed the remaining cause: Playwright moved the pointer in
one jump from the Agent trigger to a left-opening submenu. The submenu closed during hit testing,
leaving the root page to intercept the click and detaching the Provider option. Provider selection
now moves the real pointer through intermediate positions, reasserts the visible submenu state, and
then performs the semantic option click. It does not force clicks, dispatch selection through
renderer internals, retry the workflow, or depend on a delay. Three fresh focused runs each passed
all 18 steps, and `pnpm --filter @lody/e2e check` passed. The full Electron suite was not rerun
locally for this correction by explicit request.
