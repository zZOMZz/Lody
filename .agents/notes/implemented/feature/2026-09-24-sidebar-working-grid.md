# Replace the sidebar working spinner with a shared-sea tile grid

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-24-sidebar-working-grid.zh.md)

## Abstract

The sidebar marked a running session with a rotating `Loader2` arc, which reads
as "loading" rather than "an agent is working", and five or six of them spin
independently down the list. The mark is now `WorkingGrid`: a whole 3×3 grid of
tiles in the primary colour across which a slow light drifts, driven by two short
waves crossing the page plus one long rhythm wave that brightens whole marks in
turn down the list; every tile samples them at its own page position. The
animation runs on the compositor through Web Animations of `transform` and
`opacity` on one shared clock, with no per-frame script. Offscreen marks now defer
their animation creation until visible. Unmeasured: the renderer cost of 19
small animated layers per mark in a packaged build, and the effect on real readers.

## Problem

- A spinner says "wait for me". A session that is working says "I am busy on
  your behalf"; the product wanted something calmer, more on-brand (the jellyfish,
  water) and still professional.
- Several spinners in one list rotate out of step and draw the eye. Marks that
  move as one system are quieter than marks that each twinkle.
- Any replacement must keep the constraint already paid for in the
  [spinner note](../bug-fix/2026-09-13-spinner-off-svg-retina-composite.md) and
  `components/shared/AGENTS.md`: no main-thread work per frame while agents run.

## Design

The look was chosen by iterating on standalone prototypes with the product owner:
pixel jellyfish and a dot "ocean patch" read as too cartoonish or too noisy;
breathing dots, rings, bubbles and a click-ripple layer were tried and dropped.
The kept form and its defaults:

- 3×3 tiles, corner radius 40% of the tile, gap 0.18 of the tile, 12px overall
  inside the 14px status slot, in the primary colour.
- A whole grid that swells and brightens: all nine tiles always show, scaling
  between 0.3 and 0.9 of their cell (never to nothing) while opacity runs from
  0.25 (pale tiles) to 1 (primary tiles). Still, it is a dot matrix of varied
  dots; moving, light and size roll across it.
- Main wave plus ripple (`waves = 1`, the default): a main plane wave, 3.2 cells
  × 1.2 long, heading down-right with a 1.9s period, drives most of each tile's
  size and opacity on the outer layer. Every mark plays the same loop with only
  the phase differing, so each is a slightly delayed copy of the one above; this
  gives the list its rhythm. A smaller ripple (`ripple = 0.3`: the second wave,
  4.4 cells, heading down-left, 2.7s) on the inner layer swings 30% of the range
  and interferes with it, so marks are related but not identical. The ripple's
  trough is divided out of the main wave's, so together they still bottom out at
  `minScale` / `minOpacity`. Two equal crossing waves could coincide in troughs
  and shrink every tile of a mark at once; a small ripple cannot.
- `waves = 2` keeps the earlier form for comparison: two crossing waves (3.2 and
  4.4 cells, 1.9s and 2.7s) on nested layers plus a long downward rhythm wave on
  the mark (36 cells, 3.6s, 30% of the opacity range).
- Light themes compensate (`lightCompensation`, on by default). The same
  parameters looked fuller in dark mode than in light: low opacity fades a tile
  towards the background, which on a light page is near white, so dim small
  tiles vanished and only the large bright ones remained; and dark shapes on a
  light ground look smaller than light shapes on a dark ground (irradiation). In
  a light theme the opacity floor moves 35% of the way to 1, a positive size
  floor 20% of the way to 1, and tiles are drawn 8% larger (capped at the cell).
  Screenshots of the same story in both themes showed whole 3×3 marks in both
  after the change.
- One sea for the page: a tile's phase depends only on its page position. In a
  list the sea between rows is skipped ("stitched", `rowPitch = 28`): the 14px
  mark covers half of each 28px row, and without stitching a wave moves more than
  a wavelength between rows, so neighbours looked unrelated.

## Staying out of the reader's way

> Update (2026-09-25): the reading pause described in this section was removed;
> marks animate continuously. See
> [the removal note](../simplification/2026-09-25-working-grid-reading-pause-removed.md).

In the first shipped form (primary blue, opacity 0.16–1, size 0.3–0.9, full
speed, every mark moving) a sidebar of running sessions kept pulling the eye from
the conversation. Reading apps keep their chrome in the background: low contrast,
still by default, motion only for a change of state, accent colour only for what
needs the reader. Peripheral vision is most sensitive to luminance change and
motion, and many unrelated flickering points cannot be tuned out. So:

- Luminance and colour, in three rounds. First: opacity 0.5–0.8, size 0.55–0.9,
  muted grey, 0.45× — the owner found it too static to notice. Second: a 12px
  mark whose tiles shrink through zero (minimum -0.2) — rendered, the grid broke
  into scattered specks that looked like noise, were ugly when still, and were
  not recognisable; counting tiles under 30% size as invisible, a mark showed two
  or fewer tiles ~29% of the time. Third: keep the grid whole (size 0.8–0.9) and
  move light instead (opacity 0.25–1) in the primary colour at 0.6× — whole and
  recognisable, but barely moving. Fourth: scale restored to 0.3–0.9 (positive,
  so no tile vanishes) at the original speed — lively, but two waves plus the
  rhythm made marks look unrelated and sometimes all small. Final: the same
  whole grid, colour and ranges driven by one wave, so marks differ only in
  phase. That looked cheap: too regular. Final: the same main wave with a small
  interfering ripple on top. The grid shape keeps it distinct from the unread dot.
- Coherence: one wave of one shape makes a column read as the same motion
  passing from mark to mark, instead of about a hundred unrelated tiles.
- No reading pause (removed 2026-09-25, #968). The first cut froze every mark on any
  wheel, key, pointer or touch press outside the sidebar, resuming after 4s of
  quiet. In use it read as broken: scrolling the conversation stopped the
  "working" status, so a running session looked stalled exactly when the owner
  glanced at it. Marks now always move; calm comes only from the ranges and
  speeds above, and every loop starts at timeline zero so all marks share one
  clock.

None of these effects has been measured on people; the numbers above are
simulations and screenshots.

## Done transition

When a row goes from working to unread, `SessionRowStatusIndicator` plays
`WorkingGridCollapse` once before the plain unread dot: the grid spins 135° while
its nine tiles gather into the centre and fade (0–480ms), then the dot pops from
0.35× to 1.75× and bounces twice through 0.72×, 1.3×, 0.88× and 1.06× before
settling (400–1020ms). The first cut (300ms spin, 1.3× pop, one small bounce, six
fading sparks) read well magnified but was hard to see at the real 14px: the spin
was slowed, the pop and bounces enlarged, and the sparks dropped as invisible. It uses the same
compositor-only Web Animations; the hand-over to the plain dot comes from the dot
animation's `finished` promise, not a timer.

`WorkingStatusMark` packages the grid, the transition and the dot behind two
flags (`working`, `unread`); `SessionRowStatusIndicator` renders it for both
states, so it stays mounted across the change. It tracks the previous `working`
flag as state adjusted during render, so the transition is on screen in the same
commit that stops the grid. It fires only when `unread` is already true as
`working` turns false. The two flags travel separately — `working` from session
presence, `unread` from durable doc meta (`lastMessageAt` vs `lastReadAt`). The
CLI writes the unread bump before it releases presence, but the renderer receives
them on different transports with no ordering, and the doc-meta projection
applies patches a task later (`setTimeout(0)` in `atoms/doc-meta.ts`) while
presence applies at once. So presence usually cleared first: the indicator
emptied, the dot appeared later, and the transition never played in the app
although Storybook (both flags flipped in one render) showed it. Fixed
2026-09-25: `SidebarRowEndSlot` (which outlives the mark) and the related-session
chip run `useWorkingHandOver`, which keeps the grid up to 1.5s after `working` clears; an
unread write inside that window gets the transition, otherwise the hold lapses
(the user was reading the session). A row that remounts, or was never
working, shows the dot directly. Reduced motion shows the dot at once. Known seam: the
collapse starts from evenly sized tiles, while the live grid's tiles differ.
Verified by scrubbing the paused animations frame by frame in Storybook
(`UI/WorkingGrid` → Completion; `Components/LodySidebar` → Sessions finishing).

## Implementation choice

| Option                                                             | Result                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rAF loop writing styles (the prototype)                            | Rejected: per-frame main-thread work and repaint, the cost the spinner fix removed.                                       |
| CSS keyframes with per-tile `animation-delay`                      | Rejected: CSS animations start when an element mounts, so marks mounted at different moments would sit on different seas. |
| **Web Animations, `startTime = 0`, per-tile delay from the phase** | Chosen: compositor-driven, and every loop is aligned to the document timeline regardless of mount time.                   |

A sum of two sines cannot be one keyframe loop, so each tile nests two layers,
one per wave, and their scales and opacities multiply. Each layer spans the
square root of the full range, so a double trough lands exactly on the minimum.
The product of two waves reads the same as the prototype's sum: crest on crest is
largest, trough on trough smallest.

`prefers-reduced-motion` and engines without `Element.animate` render the grid
still. Superellipse tiles are available through CSS `corner-shape`
(Chromium 139+, Electron 39 ships 142).

## Explored and reverted

After this shipped, several fields were tried in Storybook and the owner chose to
return to the configuration above:

- Softer defaults (20–30% corners, 0.25–0.35 gap, tiles capped at 0.8 of the
  cell) and shorter or longer wavelengths (0.8–1.3) with faster waves.
- Four long waves whose strengths took turns dominating: neighbouring marks moved
  together, but all nine tiles of a mark moved as one block.
- Short ripples plus long swells: varied tiles and a shared rhythm, but never a
  random-looking single tile.
- Per-tile random bobbing plus occasional bands sweeping across all marks.

Those variants baked each tile's height over a 36s loop into one keyframe
animation instead of two nested sine layers; that technique remains the route if
the field changes again.

## Tuning surface

`UI/WorkingGrid` in Storybook exposes every parameter as a control (shape, scale
mode, minimum and maximum size, opacity range, rhythm share, speed, gap,
wavelength, direction, stitching, muted or primary colour) and
a `SidebarSimulation` story at production geometry: 28px rows, the trailing
status slot that swaps to Archive on hover, waiting and unread marks beside
working ones. `Components/LodySidebar` → All sessions working shows the real
sidebar with every session running.

## Follow-up: start only visible marks

Cmd+B remounts the desktop sidebar on expansion. Each working mark previously
created 18 Web Animations in its layout effect, even below the scroll viewport;
many working rows could therefore allocate animations before the sidebar's first
paint. `WorkingGrid` now shares one `IntersectionObserver` across marks and starts
those animations only when a mark intersects the viewport. On leaving, it cancels
them. The grid's static tiles remain visible, and returning marks use the existing
document-timeline zero so they rejoin the same wave phase. Engines without the
observer keep the prior immediate behavior. This structurally reduces offscreen
animation allocations, not total sidebar mount cost or every Cmd+B hitch:
visible marks and the sidebar's layout animation still have costs.

The added component test covers shared observation, offscreen inactivity,
cancellation on exit, and the shared phase when a mark returns. It passes in a
standalone checkout (23 tests); no packaged-renderer trace has been run.

The reproducible [sidebar benchmark](../../../../packages/components/benchmarks/sidebar-toggle.bench.tsx)
mounts/unmounts a synthetic 180-session list with mixed status. In production-mode
React + jsdom, 16 samples per case showed no clear mount win from the observer:
45 rendered preview rows took 154.8 ms at the baseline commit versus 156.9 ms
with this change; with all 180 rows shown, 437.7 ms versus 514.1 ms in one
run, while another all-rows run varied to 672.0 ms versus 688.8 ms. The mock
animation API omits Chromium's WAAPI and paint costs, so these numbers cannot
establish whether the observer helps or hurts actual Cmd+B frame timing. They
do establish that full sidebar remounting remains expensive, especially when
users expand every group. Storybook/Chromium measurement was attempted but the
dev server did not render the benchmark iframe within the timeout; a packaged
Electron trace remains necessary before claiming the hitch is fixed.

## Verification

- `tests/working-grid.test.tsx`: the delay reproduces the travelling wave at any
  timeline time; stitching makes consecutive rows continuous; the rhythm steps
  down a list in small increments; all 19 animations (one rhythm, eighteen tile
  layers) target HTML, touch only `transform`/`opacity`, share one start time,
  follow the speed factor, stay within the size and opacity ranges, and are
  cancelled on unmount; reduced motion stays still; the sidebar end slot shows
  the grid while working, holds it for a late unread write so the transition
  still plays, and lets it go when none arrives.
- Rendered in Storybook and inspected by screenshot.
- Not done: a renderer CPU / layer trace in the packaged Electron app with many
  sessions running. That is the check to run before widening the grid to other
  surfaces.
