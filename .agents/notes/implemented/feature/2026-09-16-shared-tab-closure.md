# Shared conversation tab closure

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-16-shared-tab-closure.zh.md)

## Abstract

Main tabs could not close, while child closes archived or deleted conversations.
Tab visibility now uses shared `SessionMeta.isTabClosed`, without lifecycle cleanup.
The closed list also includes historical archives and reopening restores them.
Selection stays local and falls back to a local new-conversation draft.

## Decisions and evidence

Window-local closure was rejected: the workspace shares its open conversation set.
Only the flag is shared; selection and order retain their existing URL/local storage
owners. A confirmed close narrowly invalidates the current URL; missing metadata
never means closed. This extends the [routing contract](../../../docs/sessions-tabs-routing.md).

Archive remains a lifecycle operation, with the target rules in
[session relations](../../../../specs/session-relations.md). Legacy archives stay in
the unified closed list instead of being bulk rewritten. Reopen uses restoration
checks and retains independent child close flags. Running work and worktrees are
unaffected by new close writes.

The [Spec](../../../../specs/session-tab-closure.md) remains draft. Hook, tab, routing
and mobile tests plus components typechecking validate the implementation; replica
tests exercise the real LoroRepo metadata boundary. Mixed old/new clients cannot
provide uniform tab behavior. Private-host allowlists and end-to-end native app
behavior are not established by unit tests.

Review corrections in [PR #746](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/746): shared-close
fallback, URL replacement, and selection persistence wait for metadata hydration so
a partial scan cannot persist a false empty state. The explicit close handler also
defers navigation during hydration, leaving selection to that reconciliation effect.
The later UX revision replaces the standalone empty surface with the existing draft
composer. `useEmptySessionDraft` reuses local input or inserts one draft before URL
selection, without clearing mobile viewers or creating shared Sessions. The empty
sentinel remains compatible; Strict Mode must not duplicate draft insertion.
Tests cover partial-to-complete fallback, existing draft preservation and single
insertion. Native visual acceptance remains separate from these tests.

Owner follow-up (2026-09-19): a successful close shows no toast, whether this or
another client closed the tab; the tab leaving the strip is the feedback. The
"This conversation tab was closed" info toast added in #746 is removed. Close
failures still surface an error toast.

The legacy-archive coupling above (archives count as closed, reopening restores) is
superseded by [orthogonal archive and closure](../bug-fix/2026-09-24-archive-independent-of-tab-close.md).
