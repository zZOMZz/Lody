# Preserve ACP capabilities across cache versions

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-08-acp-capability-cache-compatibility.zh.md)

## Abstract

A newer renderer discarded a successful GPT-6 capability probe from an older local daemon because
their cache versions differed, then silently showed a static model list. Capability readability is
now independent from refresh freshness: parsed entries keep serving understood data while version
or source checks may still schedule a replacement probe. Runtime-override source matching remains
strict, and structurally invalid data remains rejected by the existing parsing boundary.

## Decision

- `cacheVersion` remains an exact-match freshness signal so startup and explicit refresh paths can
  converge old entries to the current representation.
- UI selectors, available commands, and runtime-probe authority consume any successfully parsed
  entry, including entries with missing, older, or newer cache versions.
- Version-specific readers adapt known incompatible fields instead of rejecting the entry. The v7
  reader omits the pre-v7 non-Codex reasoning map whose bracket suffixes could describe context
  windows rather than effort, while retaining that entry's models and other capabilities.
- Runtime override matching remains an applicability gate independent of cache freshness.
- Updating static model tables was rejected as the fix because it would only mask the same failure
  for the currently known models and leave all other probed capabilities vulnerable to version skew.

## Evidence and limits

Local logs showed the Codex adapter returning GPT-6 and syncing the Machine Flock row successfully;
the stored config-scoped row carried cache version 6 while the renderer expected version 7. Unit
coverage separates readability from freshness and exercises missing, older, and newer version
markers. This does not make unknown future fields readable: entries must still pass the client's
wire or storage schema. See the [draft compatibility contract](../../../../specs/acp-capability-cache-compatibility.md).
