# Workspace switcher menu: one row system, no bespoke card

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-23-workspace-switcher-menu-redesign.zh.md)

## Abstract

The workspace-switcher dropdown stacked four unrelated geometries: menu
labels at `px-2`, action icons at `px-2`, radio rows' `ps-8` selection
indent pushing an embedded avatar plus name to a third column, and a
hand-padded current-workspace card that duplicated the checked radio row
with different metrics — so the popover read as misaligned and the card
read as foreign. The redesign deletes the card entirely: the menu is now
one uniform row system (email label, workspace radio list, action rows)
where every row shares a 20px leading box and one text column. The card's
unique information — plan and member count — moved onto the current
workspace's own radio row as trailing muted text, so the checked row is
also the most informative. `DropdownMenuRadioItem` gained an
`indicatorSide` option to move the check to the trailing edge when the
leading slot already carries an identity mark.

## Decision

`loro-sidebar.tsx`'s switcher menu:

- The `data-current-workspace` card and its separator are removed. The
  checked radio row already identified the current workspace; the card
  only added "Plus Plan · 3 members", which now renders as muted trailing
  text on that same row (`workspace.switcher.plan` / `.planAndMembers`
  i18n keys unchanged). Other rows keep their planTier badge.
- Radio rows keep the leading `WorkspaceAvatar` and switch to
  `gap-1.5 ps-2 pe-8` with `indicator="check" indicatorSide="end"`: the
  avatar aligns with the action rows' icon boxes, `pe-8` reserves the
  trailing check zone so badges/plan text never slide under it.
- `DropdownMenuRadioItem` (shared `ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`) accepts
  `indicatorSide?: 'start' | 'end'` — default `start`, so every other
  menu is untouched. This extends the primitive instead of a private
  override, per `src/ui/AGENTS.md`.
- Action rows wrap their glyph in a 20px `h-5 w-5` flex box with
  `gap-1.5`, giving radio and action rows an identical leading column at
  `px-2` and one text column.
- The "Switch workspace" group label stays: after removing the card it
  is the section anchor for the radio group.

Rejected alternatives: keeping the card but re-styling it (still a
second geometry for duplicated information); dropping avatars (implemented
first, rejected on review — avatar is the workspace identity); check
leading beside the avatar (recreates the three-column zigzag); aligning
text to the card's 56px column (pushes every row deeper).

### Reverted companion change

An "inner cohesion, outer separation" fix for the Updated session list
was implemented alongside this — a `separated` prop on
`SessionOpenedByTreeRow` adding `mt-1.5` at tree-group boundaries in
`sidebar-updated-session-list.tsx` and `session-list.tsx`. It was
reverted on review before landing: the list keeps its uniform `gap-px`
rhythm. The investigation stands — the perceived inconsistency there is
two-line parent rows vs one-line child rows at equal gaps, not unequal
spacing — but the spacing change was judged unnecessary.

## Verification

Storybook (`Components/LodySidebar`, dark) rendered before/after: the
menu is now uniform — avatars and action icons share one leading column,
all labels share one text column, and the current row shows
"Plus Plan · 3 members" with the check at the trailing edge. `tsgo
--noEmit`, `oxlint`, and `oxfmt` are clean on the touched files;
opened-by tree tests pass (the revert restores the original code path).
Not verified: radio select / context-menu / modifier-click interactions
run through unchanged handlers; multi-account (email label) and
free-plan variants were reasoned, not rendered.

## Follow-up, 2026-09-26: preserve menu ownership and the tooltip anchor

The Base UI migration in `18f10b6514` left each desktop workspace radio item
under its own `ContextMenu.Root`. Both menu families share a root context, so
the radio item read the closed context menu's highlight state instead of the
dropdown's. The tooltip also rendered the context trigger's `display: contents`
wrapper, which has no measurable box and positioned the hint near the viewport
origin. The earlier comment claiming both triggers reached the row was stale.

The radio item now resolves in the dropdown and introduces the context menu
inside its `render` callback. Its props, handlers and ref reach one real row
element, which is also the tooltip trigger. `ContextMenu.Trigger` applies
`display: contents` only to its default wrapper; an explicit `render` preserves
the supplied element's layout. The switcher trigger also drops the duplicated
child button left by the migration. Adding a CSS hover or a tooltip offset
would leave the incorrect menu ownership and anchor intact.

The composition is `Tooltip.Trigger → Menu.RadioItem → render(ContextMenu.Root
→ ContextMenu.Trigger → div)`: the outer menu owns selection/highlight, while
the inner menu owns the right-click action. The existing menu appearance and
workspace navigation intent are unchanged.

Regression coverage extends the workspace identity and shared menu suites to
check highlight movement, the hint's row trigger, dropdown selection/closure,
and a rendered context trigger's ref/layout and right-click behavior.

Verification: the two sidebar suites pass (24 tests), as does the updated menu
suite (30 tests). The UI package's existing 299 tests and its typecheck passed;
changed-file lint and formatting pass. A Chromium fixture using the real styled
primitives measured the row at y=315 and its hint at y=322, with a flex row,
active highlight and working right-click menu. This verifies the composition,
not a packaged Electron build. Existing dependency caches were reused; the full
components typecheck still reports unrelated dependency/type errors (including
Effect type identities). `docs check` is blocked by links into the uninitialized
Codex/Grok submodules; none of its errors concern the changed documents.
