# Keep forked Codex sessions subscribed

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](./2026-09-09-codex-fork-keep-subscribed.zh.md)

## Abstract

Forking a Codex Session immediately unsubscribed the child thread. The host treats that child as a live Session and waits for `turn/completed` notifications, so the first prompt never finished, Stop reported no active turn, and the next prompt was `already active`. This host change now pins `acp-extension-codex` to merged adapter #37 (`e472d56`) so a successful fork keeps the child subscribed, with `acp-extension-core` 0.1.2. The conflict refresh incorporates Lody main, including #534, and updates all submodules to their current main snapshots. Codex fork tests pass; the refreshed DSH main has a lint failure detailed below, and this change does not publish a desktop release.

## Merge update (2026-09-09)

The initial pins and merge-order warnings below describe the original proposal. Adapter #37 has now merged as `e472d56` on Codex main, after the worktree ownership fix (#35) and review completion fixture correction (#36). PR [#544](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/544) merges current Lody main, which already includes #534, and resolves the competing Codex gitlinks by selecting latest adapter main. `SessionFork.ts` is identical to the original fix commit `fc91dce`. All submodules are refreshed to their current main commits at the user's request; Core remains `9c47fec`. No adapter publication or desktop release is performed by this update.

The other refreshed pins are Claude `414718e`, DSH `5d79d5b`, Grok `c962338`, and Kimi `d3f218c`; Kimi remains outside the root workspace. Frozen-lockfile installation succeeds without changing the root lockfile. The updated Codex adapter passes both `session-fork.test.ts` and `CodexAcpClient.test.ts` (112 tests). This refresh does not repeat the real Codex or desktop UI probes recorded below.

Validation limit: root typecheck passes, but `pnpm check` stops at `typescript-eslint(no-floating-promises)` in DSH main's `scripts/settings-profile-smoke.mjs:39`. That main snapshot omits the `await test(...)` present in the previous host pin. The requested main pin is retained; this host update does not modify or publish a new DSH commit. Documentation, i18n, Code Collab, platform, and public-boundary checks pass.

## CI correction (2026-09-09)

The Static checks failure confirmed the DSH lint issue above. Upstream [DSH #14](https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-dsh/pull/14) restores `await test(...)` and is now merged into main as `ce194fd`. The host pin advances to that main commit, superseding the temporary `5d79d5b` validation limitation. The merged tree matches the verified fix exactly: DSH build, 11 unit tests, formatting, and host `check:quick` pass. No runtime implementation or lint rules change.

## Original decision

- Host gitlink `packages/acp-extension-codex` moves from main's `f9dbc8c` to `fc91dce` (open adapter PR #37, based on already-merged #35 / `400384e`).
- Host gitlink `packages/acp-extension-core` moves from `1aa2431` to published 0.1.2 `9c47fec`. Root `pnpm-lock.yaml` stays `workspace:*` and did not need a rewrite; the adapter's own npm lock inside the submodule already names Core 0.1.2.
- Lody #534 also pins Core `9c47fec` plus Codex `89b1208` (#35 plus an unmerged review-fixture test) and host AgentClient/session-manager identity code. This PR shares only the Core 0.1.2 gitlink. It does not copy #534 host files. If #534 merges first, the Codex gitlink will need a rebase onto that sibling (`89b1208` vs `fc91dce`).
- `LODY-FORK-001` remains a runtime-simulator journey (`session-fork-acp.mjs`). It can regress host fork RPC, but it does not execute the real Codex adapter and is not the fix acceptance.

## Evidence and limits

Independent review of adapter #37 (`fc91dce`) used real Codex 0.153.4 and a synthetic model HTTP endpoint: parent, fork first turn, fork second turn, parent after child, and close-child unsubscribe all passed. The same probe against the previous bundled unsubscribe hung on the first child prompt.

The rebuilt desktop CLI (`apps/electron/resources/cli/codex-acp.js` → `chunks/index-DfT2wei0.js`) keeps unsubscribe only in the `assignProject` failure path. Independent bundled-adapter replay of that new chunk passed the same live turns; the old chunk hung.

This does not publish the adapter. Desktop users stay broken until adapter #37 merges and a release includes this gitlink. Isolated Electron UI launch uses `LODY_E2E=1` and unique data/host ports so it does not take the single-instance lock from a developer's existing window. That launch is a desktop boot smoke (it opened `#/local/chat` without touching the developer's instance). It is not an in-window Codex fork. `LODY-FORK-001` was not used as fix acceptance.
