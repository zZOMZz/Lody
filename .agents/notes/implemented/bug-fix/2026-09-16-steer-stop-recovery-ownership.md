# Steer Stop and recovery ownership

Status: implemented
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-16-steer-stop-recovery-ownership.zh.md)

## Abstract

Stop could leave a steer holding the session's operation queue while its preparation or
application verdict never completed. Request-transport steers were also absent from the
raw ACP drain, and delayed results could overwrite a newer input or revive terminal history.
Local waits now end independently of raw execution: execution retains ownership through
completion or confirmed termination and projects results by exact user-turn identity.
Unknown delivery has a visible, explicit-new-send recovery path, without blind replay or
a new provider reconciliation protocol. This is not a crash-atomic provider receipt system.

## Scope and evidence

This completes the Stop and orphaned-guidance paths described in
[#477](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/issues/477) and
[#666](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/issues/666). It extends the
[pending-input decision](2026-09-14-interrupt-pending-input-exactly-once.md), retaining its
adapter `applied` / `not-applied` / `unknown` evidence and cancellation policies. Provider-side
reconciliation is unchanged; a timeout or absent notification is not evidence of refusal.
The current behavioral contract remains a [draft Spec](../../../../specs/session-history-writes.md).

## Ownership

| State                                         | Owner and release boundary                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local preparation / application wait          | Target-turn abort signal; Stop and prompt completion release the steer lane and rewrite lease (see handoff below).    |
| Submitted ACP/configuration work              | Existing execution owner; completion or confirmed termination, using one five-second drain.                           |
| Refused input                                 | Exact-id pending activation in daemon-owned `steerTurnStatuses`; ordinary claim or missing-history failure clears it. |
| Applied/unknown result before history arrives | Exact-id projection in the same map; terminal projection clears it, applied processing remains until finalization.    |
| Renderer RPC acknowledgement                  | Presentation only; never writes processing over a terminal history row.                                               |

An already-applied handoff finishes its serialized ownership transfer before completion.
A handoff adapter (built-in Claude, `upstreamTurn: 'handoff'`) answers the yielded prompt
BEFORE it reports `applied`: the old turn settles first, and the adapter confirms the steer
only when the SDK replays it. Once that steer was submitted, prompt completion therefore does
not end its verdict wait; the completion decision queues behind it. `applied` then hands off
to the successor, while a refusal or unknown result takes the ordinary completion path. Ending
that wait instead made the owner drain the steered prompt, which is the next turn, and
terminate the agent after five seconds. Stop and same-turn (Codex) steers are unchanged.
Steer configuration uses the target signal between mutations, while its outstanding call
remains tracked. A repeated Stop cannot interrupt an owner still draining a steer after its
main prompt returned. Outcome-write failure releases the application lease in `finally`.

The recovery map never rewrites `latestUserMsgId` or clears another input's missing-history
tombstone. All map changes serialize in the execution service. The watcher projects results
before selecting work. Applied provenance is excluded from ordinary restart dispatch;
an abandoned applied-processing projection becomes canceled. Unknown is stored as the
declared `delivery_unknown` history status and never selected for dispatch or edit-and-resend.
Its dialog warns about possible duplicate work before authorizing a new user turn.

New daemon responses identify recovery ownership. A failed promotion is retried once through
that owner; persistent failure is surfaced. Legacy responses retain their existing renderer
fallback. This does not promise arbitrary compatibility with old execution-status writers.

## Alternatives and limits

Writing only history loses the wakeup when metadata and history arrive independently.
Repointing the latest input can erase a newer producer activation; a queue timestamp alone
does not retain which refused input still needs its late history. The exact-id projection
avoids both without moving provider delivery decisions into dispatch.

A full durable receipt/admission ledger was not added. Queue rows still hand off on history
acceptance; producer crash before offering a steer and process death before recording a
provider verdict are not transactionally recovered. A recorded result survives via existing
metadata persistence, but cannot prove an unrecorded result. Missing result projections remain
until the matching row arrives; missing ordinary recovery inputs use the existing bounded
history wait. No live-provider frequency or universal exactly-once guarantee is claimed.

## Verification

Deterministic executor tests cover Stop and natural completion during document, prompt-block,
and configuration waits, a second queued steer, raw request drain after main prompt completion,
a handoff verdict (applied or refused) that trails the yielded prompt's answer,
late applied/refused/unknown results before history, newer activation preservation, and later
ordinary execution. Shared tests exercise terminal guards and unknown status through real
HistoryWriter/Loro peer import. Renderer tests cover delayed terminal ACKs and explicit unknown
resend confirmation. Existing termination-failure and internal-cancellation suites remain.

CLI typechecking is blocked by pre-existing DeepSeek submodule/profile export mismatches in
this checkout. Documentation checks also already report missing DSH usage-test links. The
pre-existing submodule checkouts are not modified by this change. Live provider testing is
not part of this verification.
