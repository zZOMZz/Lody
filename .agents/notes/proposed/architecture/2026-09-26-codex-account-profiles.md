# User-owned Codex accounts and endpoint credentials

Status: proposed
Translation: current

[中文](2026-09-26-codex-account-profiles.zh.md)

## Abstract

Multiple Codex accounts must not swap global authentication files or publish API
keys in shared provider environment state. The implementation uses immutable
host-owned profile bindings, native ChatGPT keyring storage, and system-vault API
generations while retaining existing local and remote provider interactions.
The pinned native runtime forwards Authorization during a same-host HTTPS-to-HTTP
redirect, so custom API requests require a user-side credential broker that rejects
redirects. Same-profile ChatGPT sessions retain concurrent native processes;
confirmed refresh contention preserves shared credentials and permits one fresh-process
startup retry, without serializing native refresh.

## Decision

[The draft Spec](../../../../specs/codex-account-profiles.md) owns the intended
product contract. Profiles live under the execution host's Lody data directory;
nonsecret metadata binds workspace, machine, provider, profile, mode, and endpoint.
Codex owns OAuth refresh. Lody stages API key generations in `@napi-rs/keyring`
2.1.0, requiring durable Linux Secret Service rather than an ephemeral keyutils
fallback. No renderer reads saved secrets back. Remote input uses the existing
context-bound encrypted interaction channel, not a separate credential transport.

A per-launch loopback broker freezes the endpoint and generation. Native processes
receive only its random capability; its upstream fetch refuses every redirect and
does not echo provider error bodies. Only model/Responses operations are accepted.
This additional local process boundary is necessary despite the initial preference
for direct native requests. A general-purpose coding-agent prompt is not an acceptable
credential probe: validation sends only synthetic text with no tools through the broker.

Global auth-file swapping, plaintext encrypted-file lookalikes, API keys in
`AgentConfig.env`, and a hosted proxy were rejected because they violate isolation,
storage, or deployment boundaries. Native API environment injection was rejected
after the redirect experiment. A second OAuth token snapshot/refresh implementation
was rejected because Codex remains the credential owner.

The initial implementation incorrectly introduced an exclusive runtime lease based
on unproven refresh concerns. It is replaced by independently owned process-use
records, registered before checking the removal tombstone. Deletion first persists
the tombstone, then waits for all records to prove exit. Unknown processes delay
credential cleanup only. Late exit proofs address their own host-generated token,
never another process's record. Existing login-operation serialization is unchanged.

Native 0.156.0 reloads shared credentials before refresh but only serializes
within each process. A controlled two-process fixture confirmed that both can
submit the same old refresh token before either persists a successor. The
adapter's legacy session-open error handler previously interpreted the losing
process's "log out" message as authority to delete the shared credential,
potentially invalidating the winner. Managed ChatGPT refresh classification now
covers new, resume, fork, and stable load session opens without automatic logout.
The stable load path previously bypassed the classifier, so restored sessions
missed the retry marker. Legacy load still propagates its original error without
entering legacy logout handling. This contains the destructive consequence but
does not coordinate native refresh.
The host recognizes only the adapter's structured reused-refresh error during
session startup. It cleans up the failed process, waits 750 ms, revalidates the
live Provider, and starts one new process. A second failure is final. This
bounded recovery uses the winner's saved credentials when available without
serializing sessions or implementing OAuth refresh outside Codex. A deleted or
changed Provider cannot authorize the retry.
Cross-process refresh serialization belongs in the native credential owner,
not a launch-time lease or a second host OAuth implementation.
The adapter mitigation is tracked separately in
[acp-extension-codex PR #58](https://github.com/LodyAI/acp-extension-codex/pull/58).
The merged adapter and matching Core pin are owned by the separate
[dependency-upgrade note](2026-09-27-codex-adapter-core-pins.md) and
[Lody #1067](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/pull/1067). This host change consumes
that pair; it does not own the version transition.

A restored Session may carry a legacy `codexAuth` value. That value verifies the
historical identity but cannot authorize a new native process: launch now requires
the current Provider to retain the same managed binding. The local removal
reconciler is asynchronous and cannot substitute for this check. New Sessions do
not write per-Session launch configuration; the missing-Provider fallback already
rejected their normal restore path, but it left legacy-bound restores exposed.
The generic edit-dialog sign-in action also conflicted with immutable ChatGPT
bindings: a ready profile is deliberately rejected by the daemon. Editing such a
Provider now explains that another account needs a new Provider; initial login
during creation and API key replacement retain their respective actions.

Older daemons ignore unknown profile fields. A persisted NUL-containing
`runtimeOverrides.codexPath` therefore makes old launch/login resolution fail before
native auth can run; supported Flock readers remove only the exact marker while
retaining the profile contract for host validation. Ordinary user runtime overrides
remain forbidden. The marker is not a credential or executable override users edit.

## Evidence and limits

The exact managed runtime is Codex 0.156.0, macOS arm64 artifact SHA-256
`27a4c6ad8d63ab0988eb2a6699fb092d999b78845c75edad1eef674064a026de`.
Pinned upstream auth storage derives the native keyring account from canonical
`CODEX_HOME`. Its refresh lock is process-local. Cross-application keychain ACLs
blocked a manually seeded refresh experiment, which is not evidence of native
refresh failure or success. The later
[synthetic refresh probe](../../../../packages/acp-extension-codex/scripts/probe-refresh-contention.mjs)
used two pinned native app-server processes with one isolated file-backed home
and a barriered local refresh endpoint. Both submitted the same old token; after
one success and one simulated `refresh_token_reused`, only the winning process
reported a usable token. A fresh third process loaded the winner's saved token.
No real account, keyring refresh, or existing credential was involved.

Executed isolated experiments used synthetic credentials only: system-vault
set/read/delete; real native API Responses completion without auth.json; different-port
redirect stripping; same-port HTTPS downgrade forwarding the secret; broker-protected
completion and downgrade rejection; two real native device logins, status, and logout
through a test HTTPS CONNECT fixture. On macOS the OS home must remain available for
the default keychain; isolate CODEX_HOME, Lody data, and Electron userData instead.
No real account or existing credential was inspected.

Behavioral tests cover generation rollback/cancel, restart, immutable bindings,
locked storage, independent homes, symlinks, concurrent/live/unknown/exited process uses,
late old-process proofs, deletion reconciliation, frozen endpoint submission, and
restore identity. The built OSS desktop passes synthetic API login and model replies,
two real native device logins and independent model replies, restoring A after B,
rejected key replacement preserving a working key, and UI vault cleanup. The
[maintained recorder](../../../../e2e/scripts/acceptance-codex-profiles.mts) retains
video and checks no profile writes `auth.json`; its external-wire fixture uses no real accounts.

The profile implementation passed `pnpm check`, formatting, public boundary,
docs check, and E2E suite checks before the bounded retry. For the retry, 32
targeted CLI tests, 825 adapter tests including stable-load refresh and legacy
behavior, 8 Core contract tests, typechecks, formatting, docs check, and boundary
checks pass. A full local `pnpm check` has not passed on this revision:
the checkout initially lacked the Electron binary, then an unrelated Git test
failed only in the concurrent run; the isolated tests passed after repairing the
binary. A standalone full CLI run timed out in unrelated worktree-broker tests.
Hosted CI remains the full-suite gate. The existing encrypted RPC suite passes;
a remote desktop end-to-end run has not been performed. Windows/Linux vault execution and real-account keyring refresh
contention remain unverified. Synthetic native refresh contention is reproduced;
adapter no-logout and bounded host startup retry mitigate its user impact but
do not prevent the native race or recover every permanent credential failure.
The recorder holds two same-account requests behind an explicit arrival barrier to
verify overlapping native execution, not refresh contention. Unknown native orphans
delay deletion cleanup, never session startup. The legacy external-history catalog
does not aggregate all managed profiles; bound replay refuses a missing provider.
New homes intentionally omit native global config/history; existing Lody project,
MCP, and skill setup remains in the normal launch path. Keep this note proposed
until independent delivery review completes; the Spec remains draft.
