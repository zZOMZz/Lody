# Repository scripts

Scripts in this directory must work in the standalone public workspace. Do not
add hosted-service deployment, billing/operator, credential, or private backend
maintenance commands here.

## Boundary checks

- `check-platform-boundaries.mjs` enforces the local/cloud dependency
  direction. Shared frontend features use platform descriptors; CLI runtime
  roots consume injected ports and do not construct cloud SDK clients.
- Keep the allowlist small and limited to deliberate adapter/composition files.
  A new violation should normally be fixed at its dependency boundary, not
  appended to the allowlist.
- `check-code-collab-imports.mjs` protects Code Collab ownership boundaries.
- `check-public-boundary.mjs` rejects closed product paths, private workspace
  dependencies/imports, unresolved `workspace:` dependencies, closed-path
  documentation, internal absolute paths in any publishable text, and captured
  transcript fixtures.
- Root `specs/` and the `.agents/` tree may contain public client and protocol
  documentation and may be linked from other documents. Root `docs/` stays a
  closed path. Their contents still undergo the same private-path, internal-path,
  and hosted-preset checks as other public text.

## Generated artifacts

- `docs/main.mjs` (exposed through `pnpm run docs <command>`) provides document queues and scoped content-hash
  review. Errors fail `check`; warnings, such as an `AGENTS.md` above the 7000-byte
  target but under the 8192-byte gate, never do. Status, check, and diff are read-only; only explicit `confirm` writes a
  topic record. Confirmation requires recoverable committed inputs and evidence,
  never changes Spec approval, and never auto-refreshes a stale baseline.
  `docs/anchors.mjs` uses TypeScript to hash declarations below `@dec:`
  markers. Check both directions against adjacent `.anchors.json` records;
  unrelated declarations must not invalidate the reviewed block.

- `generate-acp-registry.mjs` produces the public ACP registry and its bundled,
  generation-time-validated SVG icon map. Use `--icons-only` when refreshing
  icons without also updating Provider versions.
  `generate-open-source-attributions.mjs` produces the in-app attribution
  bundle and root `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Generated output must come only
  from public repository inputs.
- Never generate files containing local absolute paths, credentials, real
  transcripts, or private repository source.
- `package-kimi-runtime.mjs` builds the isolated Kimi submodule and emits only
  the ACP runtime entry, its search worker, and a generated package descriptor.
  It owns a frozen install of that isolated workspace, requires Node 24.15 or
  newer for source builds, and must verify byte-for-byte archive reproducibility.
  A clean submodule is required for a publishable manifest; dirty artifacts are
  development-only and must never be uploaded to the managed-runtime channel.

## Install ownership

- `package-pi-runtime.mjs` builds a frozen isolated Pi dependency closure, including
  all supported optional platform packages. Windows Job binaries must be supplied
  from successful CI for the exact source gitlink. Exclude pnpm installation metadata
  from artifacts; it includes builder paths and timestamps. Validate the installed
  closure with the adapter smoke and compare deterministic archive bytes.
  Preserve relative dependency symlinks; reject absolute, escaping, or dangling
  links. Exclude install-time `.bin` shims from the direct-entry runtime bundle.

- `guard-nested-workspace-install.mjs` runs before a public-root install. If an
  ancestor lockfile already owns public package importers, fail with an explicit
  parent-root instruction; never allow two pnpm virtual stores to write links
  into the same package directories.

Keep tests deterministic and side-effect-contained. Temporary files must use a
dedicated temporary directory and cleanup must never target the repository root
or a user data directory.
