# site-docs

The public Lody site: TanStack Start + Vite + Fumadocs. It owns the marketing
landing, docs, blog, changelog, pricing, download, and legal/support pages, and
builds to `site-docs/out/client`. Binding rules live in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and in each subdirectory's own `AGENTS.md`.

## Component responsibilities

- `components/landing.tsx` — landing copy, nav, and footer.
- `components/underwater-experience.tsx` — hero, in-flow product stage, and the
  post-demo stack (free scroll; no wheel lock). Styles in `app/underwater.css`.
- `components/underwater-background.tsx` — the three.js point-cloud scene and
  desktop cursor interaction.
- `components/landing-feature-tabs.tsx` — the onboarding indicator above the app
  (`.underwater-tabs`) with auto-advancing progress bars.
- `components/landing-app-preview.tsx` — the product stage: scripted ghost-cursor
  demos and their state, rendered with the replica below.
- `components/landing-replica/` — display-only replicas of the app's shell,
  conversation, composer, diff, browser, mobile, and usage/PR views. They take demo
  data as props and import nothing from the app; `scripts/app-boundary.mjs` checks
  that in `test`.
- `components/landing-preview-data.ts` — demo copy, session rows, the scripted
  conversations, and the mock diff.
- `components/marketing-atmosphere.tsx` — the shared marketing ambient field,
  hosted once by `components/site-root-provider.tsx`.
- `components/pricing-page.tsx` — pricing table, plans, and FAQ.

Demo sequencing and screenshot notes live in
[context/landing-demos.md](context/landing-demos.md). Measurements, history, and
the product replica's recorded shape are in
[landing and marketing internals](../.agents/docs/site-landing-and-marketing.md).

## Changing landing visuals

Edit `components/underwater-background.tsx` (scene/shaders) and
`app/underwater.css` (layout/legibility); copy and CTA live in
`components/landing.tsx`. Every scene knob lives in one `PARAMS` object, and
`DEFAULT_PARAMS` is the shipped look. Open any page with `?tune` for a live slider
panel, then bake copied values into `DEFAULT_PARAMS`. Verify with
`pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs build` and a screenshot; WebGL renders in headless
Chromium. There is no second legacy site tree.

## Local development

The dev server runs on port 3002. Use
`pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs preview:static` to emulate the static host.

## Static content and client startup

Every published URL is prerendered. `src/client.tsx` prepares the current router
and runs its loaders to populate browser MDX caches before calling React hydration.
`lib/prepare-hydration.ts` also observes Vite preload errors, since TanStack lazy
component preloads can swallow import failures. Failed preparation leaves the
original HTML and links intact. Optional landing effects use
`components/optional-enhancement.tsx` to isolate later render failures.

This protects direct visits with missing JavaScript; it does not guarantee recovery
from every error after successful hydration. The intended boundary is documented
in the [static content Spec](../specs/public-site-static-content.md).

### Browser verification of the production build

After installing dependencies (and building `acp-extension-core` if install scripts
were skipped), run:

```sh
pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs build
BROWSER_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/chromium pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs test:static
```

`BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` may point to any installed Chromium. Without it, install the
matching browser with `pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs exec playwright-core install chromium`.
The suite starts its own loopback static host and blocks all external requests.
It checks every published HTML page with JavaScript disabled, internal link targets,
404 behavior, actual desktop/mobile navigation, and route/article/static-data failure
recovery on real landing, blog, and Fumadocs pages. Healthy pages must also respond
to a theme change. `STATIC_TEST_PHASE=scan|faults|navigation` selects a focused phase;
the default runs all phases. JSON results and screenshots go to `out/static-verification`.

The mobile menu is a native disclosure so navigation remains usable when client
startup fails. React only adds dismissal and scroll locking.
