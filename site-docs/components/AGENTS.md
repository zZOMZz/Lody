# site-docs/components

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md` and `site-docs/AGENTS.md` also apply; the marketing-shell rules
for pricing / download / changelog live in `site-docs/AGENTS.md`.
File-by-file ownership and the visual-tuning shortcut are in
[`site-docs/README.md`](../README.md); palette detail, cost measurements, history,
and the product replica's recorded shape are in
[landing and marketing internals](../../.agents/docs/site-landing-and-marketing.md).
Demo sequencing and screenshot notes live in
[context/landing-demos.md](../context/landing-demos.md).

## Links off this site

- `site-root-provider.tsx` overrides the Fumadocs Tanstack `Link`: hrefs in
  `APP_OWNED_PATHS` (`/login`) stay plain anchors, because the client router owns no
  such route and would render the site 404 over the web app. Register new web-app
  paths there rather than patching one link.

## Marketing landing

- Mobile public navigation uses native `details`/`summary`: opening the menu and
  following its links must work before hydration and with JavaScript disabled.
  React may enhance dismissal and scroll locking, not own basic disclosure.

- The landing (`/`, `/home`, `/zh`, `/zh/home`) is an immersive WebGL "underwater
  point-cloud" hero. `landing.tsx` owns copy/nav/footer and mounts
  `underwater-experience.tsx`, which renders `underwater-background.tsx`
  (`UnderwaterPointCloudBackground`, raw three.js, no R3F).
- Page order: hero → product demo stage (in-flow) → post-demo stack (team collab
  → bring-your-own subscriptions → agent fan-out
  (`landing-orchestration-section.tsx`: short claim + tags, no diagram) →
  CLI control plane (`landing-cli-section.tsx`: scripts/CI/integration + terminal) →
  power features → mobile/Dynamic Island → closing CTA → footer.
  No bottom ACP section / built-in runtime matrix. The ACP logo marquee lives INLINE
  inside subscriptions (the "any coding agent that speaks ACP" wall), not as a bottom
  footer strip. CTA platform detection lives in `landing-cta-section.tsx`
  (iOS → App Store; desktop → updates.lody.ai; Android → APK).
- Product demos are an ordinary in-flow section (tabs + `LandingAppPreview`). Desktop
  (fine pointer): a light downward nudge on the hero spring-scrolls to the stage; past
  that, free scroll. Touch / mobile: free document scroll only (no auto-spring, no
  Scroll chevron). Preview frame is `pointer-events: none` so nested chat/scroll UI
  cannot trap wheel/touch — only feature tabs are clickable. Hero is 100dvh on all
  breakpoints so the product demo never peeks on first paint. The desktop scroll hint
  keeps its localized label and animated chevron visually centered in equal-height
  boxes. No CSS scroll-snap.
- The power-section usage frame accepts native manual scrolling and preserves default
  scroll chaining so reaching either boundary returns the wheel/touch gesture to the
  document. It rotates ranges only when visible, so number/chart transitions do not
  create permanent background work. Document scroll drives only the display-only PR
  frame's internal progress, starting once half of the frame is visible and using eased
  ends. The usage preview must define the complete `--chart-1` through `--chart-5`
  palette inside its isolated theme scope; otherwise heatmap cells or later donut
  segments resolve to transparent backgrounds. Its narrow 7-day matrix also keeps dot
  height coupled to the final constrained width so the 24-column layout cannot stretch
  circles into capsules.
- Dynamic Island is **not** simulated in the play stage — real device media in
  `landing-mobile-deep-section.tsx` only.
- No scroll dive: hero + demo stage + post-demo are ordinary flow; point-cloud camera
  stays static (`diveRef` always 0). Portrait framing pan is **width-only**
  (`framingPanX`); never re-derive pan from live aspect — Safari chrome show/hide thrash
  would re-frame mid-scroll. `.underwater-bg` uses `100lvh` (not `inset:0`/`100dvh`) so
  the canvas height does not resize with the URL bar. Demos unlock once (first stage
  reach / intersect) and stay mounted — scroll must not null `demo` or remount ghost
  scripts. Off-screen, tab fill freezes via `animation-play-state` only. Ghost pointer:
  `scrollIntoView` no-op + `focus({preventScroll})` while demos run; `ghostEnabled` false
  when stage &lt; ~55% visible so clicks/drags stop.
- Feature carousel: `landing-feature-tabs.tsx` auto-advances over worktree / diff /
  design / mobile; each drives `LandingAppPreview` `demo`. Ghost scripts must not call
  `focus()` (browser scrollIntoView yanks the page); use `clickQuiet` and controlled
  state for typing.
- `landing-agents-section.tsx` (count lockup + built-in runtime matrix) and
  `landing-control-plane.tsx` stay unmounted reference components on disk.
  `landing-agent-banner.tsx` IS mounted: the subscriptions section renders it with the
  `inline` prop as the ACP logo wall (`.uw-agents__banner--inline` drops the legacy
  absolute footer positioning). Both provider marks and the wall come from
  `landing-agents.generated.ts`
  (`pnpm --filter @lody/site-docs generate:landing-agents`).
- `underwater-background.tsx` is client-only three.js in `useEffect`. Startup is
  deliberately staged — keep all three legs when touching it: (1)
  `underwater-experience.tsx` loads it via `lazy(() => import())` (keep the
  `.underwater-bg` CSS gradient in sync with the BG shader). Start that import
  only when the experience mounts, then wait for load + idle, so docs pages that
  share the route graph never download the 3D chunk and the hero H1 can become
  LCP. (2) the initial seabed
  attributes are computed in `underwater-terrain.worker.ts` via
  `underwater-terrain-math.ts` and fade in through the terrain `uReveal` uniform, while
  gradient/particles/jellyfish render immediately; (3) first render waits on
  `renderer.compileAsync` (`ready` gate). Tune/downgrade rebuilds stay synchronous on
  the main thread.
- `underwater-experience.tsx` must mount `landing-app-preview.tsx` via `lazy()` —
  deliberately NOT module-eval `import()` like the background. The `previewArmed` latch
  fires once the stage enters the viewport (or after a long post-load idle) and never
  flips back, so first paint does not download the preview chunk. Tab durations + the
  demo id union live in `landing-demo-durations.ts`; importing them from the preview
  would pull it back into the critical chunk. The stage frame carries `aria-hidden` +
  `inert`. Hero word rotation and decorative CSS motion wait for the same load+idle
  gate (`uw-motion-ready`); `prefers-reduced-motion` still disables them.

## Product replica

- The stage is `landing-app-preview.tsx` (ghost scripts + state) over the
  display-only replica in `landing-replica/`; demo copy and conversations live in
  `landing-preview-data.ts`. The replica copies the app's markup and classes but
  never imports the app (see `site-docs/AGENTS.md`). Model only states the scripts
  reach — the frame is inert — and keep the recorded shapes in
  [landing and marketing internals](../../.agents/docs/site-landing-and-marketing.md).
  The right panel starts CLOSED; only a demo that scripts it opens it.
- Ghost scripts drive real DOM through these hooks; keep them when editing the
  replica: `textarea`, `button[aria-label="Send"]`, `[data-demo="workdir"] label`,
  `[data-slot="resizable-handle"]` (pointerdown on it, move/up on `body`),
  `button[aria-label="Browser"]`, `button[aria-label="Annotate page"]`,
  `[data-demo="pv-*"]`, `[data-message-role]`, and the mobile tab bar's
  `MOBILE_NEW_CHAT_LABEL` button. `test:static` waits for the stage `textarea`.
- Replica tokens are the `.lody-app-preview` scope in `app/global.css`; add a token
  there when copied app classes need one instead of reaching for app CSS.
