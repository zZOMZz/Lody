# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lody! Bug reports, documentation improvements, tests, and new features are all welcome.

## Contribution Terms

By submitting a pull request, patch, or other contribution to Lody, you agree to the following terms:

- You have the right to submit the contribution. It is your original work, or you have the necessary permission to contribute it.
- Unless you explicitly state otherwise in writing, your contribution is submitted under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
- You retain copyright in your contribution. You grant Lody and all recipients the rights provided by the Apache License, including the right to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the contribution.
- Lody may use contributions in open-source and commercial products and services, subject to the Apache License.
- If you cannot agree to these terms, please do not submit the contribution. A separate written agreement with Lody takes precedence over these terms.

## What we can review

Thank you for wanting to help. Lody is a production codebase with invariants that are easy to break in a large diff and expensive to rediscover (the local/cloud boundary, catalog contracts, protocol capabilities). A large unsolicited patch often cannot be reviewed safely, even when the intent is generous.

This is ordinary open-source practice: maintainers own the architecture. The most useful first contribution is often a clear Issue with reproduction or analysis, not a rewrite. Small, focused pull requests that change one thing are welcome. Closing a large PR is a statement about review capacity and risk, not about your effort.

**Community contributors** (anyone who is not a Lody team member, and who has not been assigned the corresponding Issue by a maintainer):

1. Keep the pull request under **1000 changed lines** (GitHub additions + deletions). We only review community PRs under that size.
2. If the work would exceed 1000 lines, open an Issue with your analysis first. Those reports are welcome. Do not open a larger PR unless a maintainer assigns you that Issue.

Lody team members work on same-repository branches and are not subject to this cap. A fork remains an external contribution even when the author is a team member.

## Before You Start

1. Search existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicate work.
2. Report reproducible problems with the [bug report form](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/issues/new?template=01-bug-report.yml), or propose improvements with the [feature request form](https://github.com/LodyAI/Lody/issues/new?template=02-feature-request.yml).
3. For a fork-based contribution, use an existing Issue when one provides useful context. Same-repository branches do not require an Issue solely for contribution intake.
4. Do not report security vulnerabilities in a public issue; follow the [security policy](./SECURITY.md) instead.

Keep the selected Issue Form structure, required answers, confirmations, and `[Bug]` or `[Feature Request]` title prefix. Issues that do not conform are marked `status:needs-issue-body` with a warning until corrected. Only repository owners and automated bots are exempt; regular organization members must also use the forms.

## Get the Code

The repository uses Git submodules for ACP runtimes, so clone it recursively:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LodyAI/lody.git
cd lody
```

For an existing checkout, initialise the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Local Development

You need Node.js 22.14-22.x or 23.6+ (Node-API 10+) and the pnpm
version specified by this project.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start:local
```

This builds the local CLI and open-source desktop renderer, then launches Electron. The first run may take a while. Fully quit any existing Lody desktop process first because the app allows only one running instance.

The open-source build is local-first: it needs no `.env` file, Lody account, or cloud environment variables. Cloud endpoints and telemetry variables are not used.

## Isolate Local Data While Developing

By default, the open-source desktop app stores data in `~/.lody-oss`. To avoid using existing data during development, set `LODY_DATA_DIR`:

```bash
LODY_DATA_DIR="$(pwd)/.lody-dev-data" pnpm start:local
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:LODY_DATA_DIR = "$PWD/.lody-dev-data"
pnpm start:local
```

This variable is optional. Never commit the generated data or credentials.

## Submitting Changes

For changes to important behavior or architecture, follow the
[document maintenance workflow](./.agents/README.md). Specs explain intent and require explicit human
review. Significant decisions belong in an Agent Note; routine styling and local
fixes normally need only a PR explanation. You may contribute in either English
or Chinese; maintainers can arrange the counterpart after merge. Agents instead
follow [the note rules](./.agents/notes/AGENTS.md#history-and-language) and ship
both languages in the same change. Invariants
continue to live in the nearest `AGENTS.md`.

1. Create a clearly named branch from the latest code.
2. Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated formatting or refactoring.
3. Add or update tests for behavior changes, and make sure the existing tests pass.
4. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages, for example:

   ```text
   feat: add workspace search
   fix: handle empty session title
   docs: improve local setup guide
   ```

5. Open a pull request using the [pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Every fork-based pull request must reference a Lody Issue and fill in the problem, summary, test plan, and Context handoff. Use `Closes #123` when merging the PR should close the Issue, and `Refs #123` only when it must remain open. A bare `#123` or full Lody Issue URL in `Related issue` defaults to `Closes #123`. The handoff preserves the original prompt verbatim and must declare the conversation-sharing status using the template: a public link from any authoring tool, or a concrete reason for user refusal, unavailable sharing, or no Agent use. If the user refuses sharing, include their exact reply in a separate fenced block headed `#### Sharing refusal (verbatim)` under `### Original user prompt`, without changing the original prompt. Agents must ask before opening the PR and wait for the response; silence is not refusal. Redact only private spans with explicit markers. Placeholders and entirely redacted evidence are not accepted.

If an Agent prepares a fork-based contribution, it must explain that the Context handoff is public and an invalid PR receives seven days to be corrected before closure. An Agent preparing a same-repository branch must not create an Issue solely to satisfy contribution intake.

A fork-based pull request that does not meet the contribution requirements is marked `status:needs-pr-attention`. All findings share one comment and one seven-day correction period. A change over 1000 additions plus deletions without a maintainer assignment on the linked Issue, or over 200 without its prior Issue reference, adds a size-specific finding rather than a separate status. A valid edit clears the managed state automatically.

If the PR remains invalid after seven days, it is marked `status:pr-policy-expired` and closed. Continue through a new pull request using the current template. A maintainer may apply `status:pr-policy-bypass` for an exceptional PR; while present, automation does not modify its Issue reference or enforce contribution requirements, and it clears prior managed policy state. Removing the label resumes normal enforcement.

Pull requests are automatically labeled with one or more `scope:*` labels based on the changed paths. The [scope mapping](./.github/labeler.yml) uses each top-level key as a label name and its globs as matching paths; the [scope workflow](./.github/workflows/pr-scope.yml) creates or applies matching labels and removes configured labels that stop matching. Manually applied and unconfigured labels are left unchanged.

## Code Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and directory structure.
- Do not commit secrets, access tokens, real user data, or user/agent transcripts. Test data must be synthetic.

Thank you for contributing!
