/**
 * One token group for a control that stays pressed, a set of them, and the bar
 * that holds them.
 *
 * They are one family for the reason `disclosure` covers three layouts of one
 * idea: a `ToggleGroup` is a row of `Toggle`s that answer to one value and a
 * `Toolbar` is the row itself, so what a pressed control looks like and how far
 * apart two of them stand cannot become three decisions in three files.
 *
 * It is deliberately not the `field` group. A Switch stores a value in a form —
 * it takes a name, answers to a `Field.Root` and can be invalid — while a
 * Toggle states that an option is on right now: bold, wrapped lines, this
 * filter. Nothing here has a name, a validity or a message under it.
 *
 * The size ladder is `control`'s rather than `Button`'s, though a Button and a
 * Toggle standing in one bar have to line up. They line up because both read
 * the same scale, not because one reads the other's group: a component group is
 * not another component's to name, which is the rule that keeps a menu from
 * reaching for `field.background`. `mini` is off that ladder, so it is stated
 * here the way `Button` states its own.
