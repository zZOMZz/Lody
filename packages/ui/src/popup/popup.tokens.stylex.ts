 * One token group for everything that floats over the page — the Select popup,
 * the Combobox popup, the menus, and the Popover that holds content instead of
 * rows. It is deliberately not part of the `field` group: a trigger is a
 * control on the well rung and reads `field`, while the list it opens is on the
 * floating rung and shares its vocabulary with a menu rather than with an input.
 * A menu that reached for `field.background` would be naming the wrong thing to
 * get the right colour.
 *
 * A Popover is the same surface with prose on it rather than commands, so it
 * reads this group too. Giving it one of its own would mean two floating
 * surfaces that can drift apart — a popover and the menu beside it opening at
 * two radii over two shadows — which is exactly what `menu-styles.ts` was.
