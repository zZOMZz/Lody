 * `scrollHeight` counts the padding, so a padded panel is cropped by exactly
 * its own padding under `border-box` and overshoots by it under `content-box`.
 * The padding therefore belongs to a child — `body` below — and the panel keeps
 * nothing but the motion and the overflow that hides what is on its way in.
