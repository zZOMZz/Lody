/**
 * One token group for the three ways a surface shows one thing out of several:
 * the Tabs strip, the Accordion and the Collapsible.
 *
 * They are one family for the reason `dialog` covers three modals: what differs
 * is how the choices are laid out and how the thing arrives, not what either is
 * made of. A tab strip lays the choices side by side and swaps the panel under
 * them; an accordion stacks them and opens one in place; a collapsible is a
 * single one of those rows with no list around it. All three are a trigger and
 * the thing it shows, so the colour a closed row's label takes and the colour a
 * tab you are not on takes cannot drift apart into two decisions.
 *
 * It is deliberately not part of `field`: none of these three holds a value.
 * A Tab picks what is shown, not what is stored, so it takes no name, answers to
 * no `Field.Root` and has no invalid state — it only borrows the well the field
 * family also sits in, which is the elevation ladder's doing rather than a
 * shared component vocabulary.
