 * One token group for every surface on the modal rung — the Dialog, the
 * AlertDialog that asks a question before it will go away, and the Drawer that
 * arrives from an edge of the window. They are one family for the reason
 * `field` is one: the three differ in how they arrive and in what may dismiss
 * them, not in what they are made of, so a padding or a title colour has one
 * place to change rather than three.
 *
 * The modal rung is the elevated background under the large shadow, over the
 * overlay — the one rung in the ladder that states all three together, because
 * a panel that owns the whole window has to separate from a page it is still
 * showing.
