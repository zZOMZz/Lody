/**
 * What a table is made of, and what the pager under it is made of.
 *
 * A table has no surface: no background, no shadow, no radius. It is rows on
 * whatever the surface around it already was, which is why the one thing it
 * draws is the line between one row and the next — the single edge the rules
 * give a list. The head is a row like any other and takes that same line; the
 * rule against a line under a header is about a heading over a surface, not
 * about a row of column names, and a head separated from its rows by nothing
 * reads as the first record.
 *
 * That line is the `inset 0 -1px 0` every other row in this package draws, and
 * the table is laid out with `border-collapse: separate` so it can be. Under
 * `collapse` a row's own box-shadow is not painted, a sticky head's border does
 * not travel with it, and a row could not carry a focus ring; under `separate`
 * all three work, and the row keeps one `box-shadow` in which its line and its
 * ring compose — which is the rule the rest of the package already follows.
