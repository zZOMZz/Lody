/**
 * One token group for a table and the pager under it.
 *
 * They are one family for the reason `dialog` covers three modals and `field`
 * covers a checkbox and a select trigger: a pager exists because a table did
 * not fit, the two sit on the same rung of the page and state the same size,
 * and a row's line and the gap between two page buttons are the same decision
 * about how dense a list of records is. A pager that took a group of its own
 * would let a table go quiet while its pager stayed loud.
 *
 * A table has no surface of its own. It has no background, no shadow and no
 * radius: it is rows on whatever the surface around it already was — a page, a
 * card, a dialog — so the card that holds it keeps owning its own edges. What
 * the rules give a table is the one edge a list is allowed, `separator`
 * between one row and the next.
 *
 * The one exception is a head that stays while its rows scroll under it, which
 * is no longer a row: it is a band over them, and the ladder already has a rung
 * for a band over the page. Anything else on it would show through.
 *
 * The two fills are the palette's own `hoverFill` and `selectedFill` rather
 * than a mix of the surface, which is the opposite of what a popup row does.
 * The rules say why: those two were tuned against the page and card rungs, and
 * a table row is exactly the row they were named for. A popup derives its own
 * only because on the floating rung they collapse into the surface.
