 * keeps every floating surface one surface.
 *
 * A tone is a tint and a mark, never a fill. The tint is mixed here rather than
 * frozen into a token, because it is a mix *of a surface* and the two surfaces
 * are on different rungs: an Alert sits on the card rung and a Toast on the
 * floating one, so the same 8% of the same tone has to be taken from two
