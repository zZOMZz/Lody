 * The mark that says work is under way with no idea how long it will take.
 *
 * It is called a Spinner rather than a Loading, because it is the mark and not
 * the state: where it goes, whether the surface around it is dimmed and what it
 * is waiting for are the surface's decisions, and a component called `Loading`
 * that centres itself in a box has already made two of them.
 *
 * It is drawn in `currentColor`, so a ghost button's label and a page's
 * secondary text each get a mark that belongs to them, and the ring behind the
 * arc is that same ink kept back — one declaration rather than a token per
 * context. It keeps turning under reduced motion: it is the only thing saying
 * the work has not stopped, and a still spinner says it has.
 *
 * The caller's `className` lands on the turning wrapper, not the glyph inside
 * it. The wrapper's box is the glyph's box — the svg fills it — so a margin
 * there spaces the mark while a margin on the glyph would grow the animated
 * box asymmetrically and turn the spin into an orbit.
