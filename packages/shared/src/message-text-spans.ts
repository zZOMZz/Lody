/**
 * Mention spans carried alongside a `text` message item.
 *
 * A user prompt is rewritten on its way to the agent: `$skill` becomes a skill
 * instruction, a session mention becomes `[@Title](session://<id>)`, and a
 * pasted-text placeholder becomes the whole pasted blob. The stored `text` is
 * that rewritten string — it has to be, because it is the exact string the
 * agent receives — so by the time the transcript renders it, every trace of
 * what the user actually typed is gone.
 *
 * A span records the mapping the rewrite already computed and used to throw
 * away: this region of the final text stands for that mention. One string,
 * two readers — the agent reads the text, the transcript paints a chip over
 * the region and shows the user's own wording back to them.
 *
 * ## Offsets
 *
 * `start`/`end` are UTF-16 code unit indices (plain JS string indices) into
 * the sibling `text`, half-open. Producer and consumer must agree on the unit;
 * everything here indexes the same way `String.prototype.slice` does.
 *
 * ## Trust
 *
 * Spans ride the session document's `.catchall(...)`, which performs no
 * validation, so they arrive unvalidated from whatever wrote them — including
 * a future or a buggy client. `sanitizeMessageTextSpans` is the only supported
 * way to read them, and every boundary that touches a text item runs it.
