# Session history

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Parent guidelines apply.

- `HistoryWriter` is the only history writer. Reuse its validation, changed-field
  diff, legacy representation, stored-copy and conditional rollback rules.
  Shared business rules live in the planners, not in UI or CLI copies.
- Directory reads contain identities, scalars and input configuration, never
  bodies. Model summary reads use the narrow scalar/count reader, including legacy
  rows; never serialize items, plans, or provider extension metadata. Input configuration projects on first read and memoizes: the
  projection is a schema parse per user turn, and a directory read covers the
  whole conversation to answer a question about its tail. Targeted reads materialize only the selected turn. Status queries use
  the directory; explicit export/replay uses one consistent `readAll` observation.
  `readTurnOutput` reads the selected assistant and relevant failure notices in
  one observation instead of serializing the transcript on every token.
- Repeated identity lookups reuse an unchanged pending transaction. Reads must not
  commit writes; uncommitted structural/ID edits and checkout still invalidate lookup.
- Subscribe and capture the initial directory without a gap. Notifications carry
  structural ranges or changed turn ids. A content batch reports the EXACT
  positions it touched, never the span between the lowest and highest: one batch
  routinely carries an early status write plus the streaming tail. The display
  cache rejects stale async reads. Turn ID edits (including deletion) are structural:
  notify by position so readers can remove the old identity before re-keying. CLI reads in-process synchronously; auto-seen
  scans directory scalars only and permission checks have no await gap.
- Ordinary commands propagate writer errors; absence returns a boolean where the
  caller needs it. Only import and editable-tail replacement use phased results:
  `rejected` proves no write; `indeterminate` must not be retried automatically.
  The repo owns persistence and remote convergence barriers.
- A snapshot is the HistoryWriter's detached, unforgeable stored-copy handle.
  Its existing provenance WeakMap is authoritative. Source disposal does not
  invalidate a capture held by a fork. Do not add a second handle registry,
  backend capabilities, store tokens or source-lifetime coupling.
- Tail replacement rechecks the expected user/provider boundary and active goal
  inside the write. Await conditional rollback before persisting follow-up meta;
  rollback retains later appends and refuses to overwrite concurrent edits.
- Import inputs are explicit data. Recheck current history/cursor and bind the
  stored baseline and cursor in the same synchronous write, without an await gap.
  A cursor failure after history mutation is indeterminate.
- Canonical import hashes are versioned: v1 hashes `{role, items, plan}` verbatim;
  v2 hashes a canonical item form that excludes tool payload from identity. Cursor,
  metadata digest and stored baseline each carry their own version; absent means v1.
  Compare only same-version hashes, recomputing from the replay when versions differ;
  unknown versions or missing replay data refuse before any write. A metadata-only
  conflict marker never upgrades the stored cursor by implication.
- `user-status` writes every stored copy of a duplicated user turn through
  `updateCopies`: the last copy gates guarded writes, settled copies never regress,
  and any started or settled copy vetoes a requeue.
- Legacy inline rows and unchanged unknown fields survive updates. Never rewrite
  history while opening or reading. Auto-seen is a separately attached CLI policy
  with a commit-time guard against regressing an advanced execution status.
- Test the real Loro reader and writer. Delayed reads use small injected Promise
  gates; there is no test-only implementation of the complete command API.
- Normalized subagent events persist inside `subagent_task.run`, keyed by root ACP
  session plus run id. Bind the initiating turn once; child output never changes root
  turn identity, plan, tools, or accounting. Ignore unregistered/terminal output,
  reject lineage cycles, and retain incomplete observation across snapshots. Declare
  nested transcript streaming fields in `schema.ts`; legacy rows stay unchanged.

- Submissions append on the live doc as local commits; transports upload only
  local events. Never author on a fork and import the export: it misses upload,
  copies the whole doc and adds a permanent peer.
