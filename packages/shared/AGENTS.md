# Shared contracts

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

Discover archive/restore/delete targets from one ready Repo snapshot, never UI caches.
Archive uses `collectSessionArchiveTargets`; restore/delete keep direct containment.
Exact deletion bypasses discovery. See [relations](../../specs/session-relations.md).

## Session history

- Session history storage tolerates unknown string item types from newer peers without
  rewriting them or blocking unrelated writes. Keep known-type guards and external-input
  parsing; `tests/session-doc-forward-compat.test.ts` covers this separately from unknown root keys.
- `createSessionMirror` is the renderer/CLI session entrypoint. Its `HistoryWriter`
  owns local history writes, including legacy callback updates; no raw history writes
  or second Mirror writer. Read-path feature flags must never change this owner.
- Validate new turns and changed known fields/items before applying a command, never
  unchanged history. Invalid commands preserve the old values and throw content-free
  diagnostics; they must not leave partial history writes. Keep stored unknown fields
  and unchanged opaque items; do not sanitize/rewrite a whole stored document.
- New inputs use the shared message parsers. Known protocol extension dictionaries
  retain JSON data, not arbitrary JS objects. Storage layout is an insertion policy in
  `schema.ts`: new metadata strings stay primitive and `LoroText` is declared only for
  streaming fields, at every nesting level. Stored values keep their representation and
  opening never rewrites them.

- Parser coverage must include nested discriminators (`system_notice.name`) and
  correlated metadata, not just item `type`. Fork regression tests must cross the
  actual SessionDocument/HistoryWriter boundary; a mock updateHistory cannot prove it.
- Copying stored history uses a writer-captured snapshot, never a caller-supplied "trusted"
  array. Preserve unchanged opaque content; parse authored changes and new notices. Prepend
  copies without replacing target initialization containers; reject colliding ids. Rollback
  captures only the changed range, retains untouched/later rows, and rejects row identity/order
  edits in that range, except pending-to-seen on newly inserted user rows.
  External ACP imports remain new input.
- Session data ports (`src/session-data`): UI/CLI business depends on `SessionData`
  (explicit set/clear and shared writer validation), never a second history writer.
  Invariants: [session-data scope](src/session-data/AGENTS.md).
- Tool fields other than type/toolCallId are independent
  edits: derive their parsers from the tool message schema and validate changed fields,
  not untouched stored payloads. Content-list edits retain unchanged blocks and parse
  authored blocks; tool identity changes still use the complete item parser.
- Normalize legacy built-in CLI selectors on new history input only. Independent stored
  input-config metadata edits validate changed fields, not untouched historical values.
- ACP tool blocks and locations are explicit JSON extension boundaries. Unknown block
  types must not bypass validation of malformed known variants. Preserve declared `_meta`
  and extension keys; closed execution configuration still selects declared fields.
- Steer provenance is a declared history input-config field, not an unknown extension.
  Both new writes and read normalization must retain it for edit-and-resend checks.
- Scalar/fileDiff writes read and diff only the requested field, never the turn's items.
  Writer input parsers derive from schema definitions with all refinements retained;
  never mutate the original RPC schemas. Parsing filters and validates in one pass.
  `readStored` returns detached JSON for hashing, not stored-copy provenance. Keep `capture`
  protection for callers that can author copies from an old snapshot.
- Target-local streaming uses `updateEntry`; it must not produce/plan the entire history.
  Resolve the live turn on each call, preserve immutable ids, and preflight before writing.
  Generic history updates remain for operations with cross-turn ownership or structural edits.
- Permission responses inspect request metadata and materialize only the matching turn;
  a supplied turn id restricts lookup to that turn. Preserve legacy JSON metadata on lookup.
- Mirror's text-event optimization ships upstream in pinned `loro-mirror`; no local patch
  exists and no storage schema or write validation depends on it.
- Subagent events must preserve run identity and root ownership.

## Machine protocol negotiation

- Ask Question consumers must preserve Core note/replacement semantics and validate
  associations per the [notes contract](../../specs/ask-question-answer-notes.md).

- Independent Plan configuration uses Core's boolean `plan_mode`, including static
  capabilities, semantic dispatch, and UI toggles. Preserve `collaboration_mode`
  default/plan only for agents that advertise the legacy option; planning must not
  change permission policy.

- Daemon-backed workflows negotiate versions through
  `MachineMeta.protocolCapabilities`; never infer from the CLI release. Missing
  capabilities mean unsupported. Set and version checks share one binding in
  `packages/shared/src/machine-protocol-capabilities.ts` so a key never travels
  without its version.
- ACP capability `cacheVersion` controls refresh freshness, never readability. Consumers
  preserve understood fields from parsed older or newer entries during mixed-version
  operation, adapting only fields with known incompatible semantics; runtime-override source
  matching remains a separate applicability gate.

## Session goal control

- A goal action's transport follows what it does, not what the agent is. Status-only
  actions (`pause`, `clear`) use the `_lody/session/goal` request and must reach a
  goal whose prompt is still open; actions that start work (`set`, `resume`) run
  inside a Lody-owned prompt carrying `_meta.lody.goalControl`, because every unit of
  agent work needs a conversation entry to be attributed to. Never start goal work
  from the request path.
- Offer only the actions the runtime advertised in its ACP capability, never a
  provider name check. A goal turn carries no run configuration, so resuming cannot
  change model or mode. Behavior: [goal control Spec](../../specs/session-goal-control.md).

## Workspace MCP and Agent Roles

- Workspace MCP has exactly two durable layers: catalog entries in the workspace Flock
  document and selected ids in each user turn input config. Do not add machine bindings.
  Preserve `mcpServerIds: []` as an explicit empty selection; dispatch must carry the
  driving turn's selection into ACP startup rather than rereading session history.
- MCP/Role catalog writes resolve on local Flock durability, followed by explicit
  upload. Settings neither await nor report upload; upload failure must not fail or
  roll back a durable write. CLI reports its sync result. See
  [catalog explanation](../../.agents/docs/workspace-catalog-durability.md).
- Roles use one workspace Flock `agentRole` family; sharing updates `visibility`.
  Store no secrets, API keys, MCP selections, or memory; apply
  `isSensitiveAgentRoleConfigOptionKey` on read and write. Roles pin permission via
  `runConfig.modeId` or `_permission`; hide the separate composer permission button
  when pinned, but keep warning-tone modes visibly marked on every such surface.
  Role-level auto-approval policy is out of scope. Settings/mentions use
  `canReadAgentRole`/`canManageAgentRole`; MCP resolves explicit Role ids from the
  catalog without requiring mention-scoped authorization.
- Roles bind exact `machineId + agentConfigId`, never fall back, and remain listed
  with precise reasons but unmentionable when machine/config/model/mode is unavailable.
  Before Operation acceptance, MCP resolves the current `agentRoleId` row and freezes
  canonical Prompt, target, Role revision, and dispatch config into the Operation;
  edits/deletion cannot change recovery or retry. `SessionMeta.agentRoleId` and
  `agentRoleRevision` are display-only creation provenance.
