## Session turns have one read path and one write path

A session document's `history` is the one piece of state that grows without
bound, so the windowed path avoids mirroring it into memory as an array. Everything goes through
`SessionDocStore`:

- **Read** `store.history` — a `ConversationView`: `index(i)` for the always-present
  per-turn row, `turn(i)` for a hydrated turn, `acquireRange` and its release handle to hold a
  window. In React use `useSessionDoc().history`, `useConversationTail`,
  `useTurnRange`, or `useSessionTurnFacts` for a whole-history fact.
- **Write** domain commands through `store.sessionData` (`@lody/shared/session-data`):
  `applyHistoryAction`, `appendTurn`, `replaceTurn` and
  `respondPermission`. It is composed over the same doc and the
  one shared writer; a rejected command surfaces as a failure, never a silent drop.
- The composition owns one HistoryWriter; the UI store does not expose it.
  Do not add a second writer or bypass `sessionData` for ordinary turn writes.

`getState()` has no `history` key and `setState` receives a draft without one,
so the ordinary spellings of a second path do not compile. What types cannot
close is a deliberate escape — a cast that puts the key back, or reaching past
the store into the raw `LoroDoc` — and
`tests/no-materialized-history-in-components.test.ts` fails on those. No component reads the raw history list; composition injects the shared reader.

Full-history actions use the authoritative consistent full-read operation.
Performance comparisons must use the current full-Mirror baseline.

## Lightweight hosted entries

- `lib/client-build-info.ts` owns build provenance for About and reports. Bug report
  metadata contains only build constants, distinct from remote machine logs.

- Public/auth entry points that bypass the full product router import route-agnostic
  surfaces. Keep host navigation behind callback props so those surfaces do not import
  the route tree, `RuntimeProvider`, or workspace Flock document implementation. When
  an auth transition selects the destination, the host owns both the non-redirecting
  auth action and navigation so an auth helper cannot discard route-specific state.

## Soft-keyboard viewport handling

- Native non-iOS side drawers without snap points use `ui/drawer.tsx`'s live
  viewport bottom inset when input repositioning is enabled. Never cache a
  keyboard-shrunken drawer height or infer keyboard visibility from focus:
  Android-compatible shells can resize the WebView and retain input focus on hide.
  Preserve the separate iOS native keyboard offset and bottom-sheet handling.
  `repositionInputs={false}` explicitly opts out of both Vaul repositioning and
  this inset; callers using it own their keyboard layout.

## Working session status

- Session marks use `ui/working-status-mark.tsx`, mounted across the status change
  and fed via `useWorkingHandOver` because unread arrives after presence.
  `WorkingGrid` shares one viewport observer: only visible marks animate; returning
  marks sample the shared clock. Animate only `transform`/`opacity` from
  `startTime = 0`, never per-frame script or React state.
  [Decision](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-24-sidebar-working-grid.md).

## Keyboard navigation

- Each independently navigable list owns one `FocusScope` and one
  `useListKeyboardNavigation` call. Rows expose `data-scope-item` plus a stable
  `data-id`; Up/Down (and J/K) move only in the active scope, while the shell's
  single scope switcher uses Left/Right between visible leaf scopes. A local
  control may keep a key by calling `preventDefault`; text inputs are never
  intercepted. Nested parent scopes yield to their visible child scopes, and an
  open dialog's scopes never switch focus into the background workspace.

## Zen layout

- Zen preserves sidebar preferences when hiding/restoring a visible layout.
  If all available sidebars are already closed, its toggle reveals them instead.
  The mounted desktop Session owns `zenRightPanelAtom` and clears it on unmount.
  Behavior: [Zen layout](../../../specs/zen-layout.md).
- An explicit request to show either sidebar exits Zen and reveals that sidebar. Use
  the shared layout-state actions for the navigation sidebar; every Session action
  that opens a viewer, Files, Changes, PR, Browser, or Side Chat must clear Zen.
- Drive hidden-panel work from effective visibility (`open && !zen`), not the stored
  open bit. A Zen-hidden PR, Browser, viewer, or Side Chat must pause exactly like an
  ordinarily collapsed right panel.

## Workspace transitions

- Dock counts derive from complete active metadata and the sidebar's child activity
  summary. Publish absolute snapshots, including zero, on change and every 30 seconds;
  focus/visibility restoration reconciles too. Keep the timer independent of count
  changes and mount it only in the ready workspace's elected window.

- Authenticated workspace switches keep `MainLayout` mounted: the sidebar and
  workspace identity are stable chrome, while the content pane shows a scoped
  placeholder until route, runtime, and doc-meta ownership agree. Pending scope
  still fails closed — never retain the previous workspace's rows or `<Outlet />`
  content — and passes `workspaceReady={false}` so workspace-owned background work
  and the mobile workspace stack do not start early. The workspace identity's
  syncing state follows that same scoped readiness, not the coarser connection
  state; an online transport does not imply that workspace data is ready.

## Billing data

- When authenticated user and workspace resolution completes, preload the billing
  overview into the existing session-scoped billing-page cache. The preload is only
  a latency optimization: billing permissions, quota checks, destructive-operation
  guards, and Stripe invoice history keep their existing live/on-demand data paths.

## ACP selectors

- Built-in Codex reasoning selectors normalize cached options against exact model support
  in `components/shared/acp-selector-options.ts`: GPT-6 Astra/Sol and GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra
  expose Max/Ultra; GPT-6 Luna and GPT-5.6 Luna expose Max only. Keep this aligned with
  the ACP model catalog; a model version threshold cannot represent per-model differences,
  and cached efforts may belong to a different selected model.

## ACP authentication

- Custom and Registry Provider authentication renders supported agent-driven method choices and
  request-scoped URL plus text/secret/single-select form interactions. Form replies use the
  encrypted authentication-input path; deprecated `env_var` and non-interactive terminal methods
  do not become Provider-config credential forms. Authorization pages are HTTP(S) only. Bind every
  progress event and reply to the exact machine/config/launch/env snapshot that started the request;
  changing that target cancels the old request, and a late reply must not clear or report an error
  over a newer interaction. Clear manual codes and form values on completion, cancellation, target
  change, and failure; never seed a secret field from retained progress.
