/**
 * Chip styling for composer mention ranges.
 *
 * Product-side on purpose: the mention primitive knows how to *paint* a chip
 * without disturbing the caret, but never which kinds are chips or what they
 * look like.
 *
 * ## The one rule
 *
 * A mention may not change the advance width of the range it decorates. The
 * highlighter mirrors the textarea character for character; a decoration one
 * pixel wider than its raw text drags every following glyph out from under the
 * caret. So the classes below set colour and nothing else — no padding, no
 * border, no font change. That constraint is also why there is no background:
 * a fill would need padding to look like anything, and padding is the one thing
 * that cannot be spent here.
 *
 * ## Which mentions get an icon
 *
 * Only the ones where an icon says more than the trigger character already
 * does. An icon has to be painted over characters the range already contains
 * and may not hang past them, so it can never be wider than what it replaces —
 * which makes it a poor trade against a `#`, `$`, or `/` that already names the
 * type perfectly well. Those keep their sigil and take the colour instead.
 *
 * Four exceptions earn the space:
 *
 * - `@file` / `@dir`, where the glyph carries information the text does not:
 *   which kind of file it is. `@` is also the widest trigger, so it is the one
 *   with room worth spending.
 * - `@session`, whose committed text is a bare `@<title-slug>` — nothing in it
 *   says "session", so without a glyph it is indistinguishable from a path.
 * - `@agent_role`, a bare `@<mentionSlug>` for the same reason, and one whose
 *   consequence — creating a Session — is worth being able to see at a glance.
 * - Pasted text, which has no trigger at all and buys a gutter with real
 *   characters — a figure space (U+2007, digit-width and non-breaking) at each
 *   end of the `[Pasted N chars]` label. Widths match exactly because the
 *   spaces really are in the text, and the label still degrades to something
 *   readable if the range is ever lost.
