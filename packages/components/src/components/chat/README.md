# components/chat

The new-chat landing and the reusable composer shell it renders. Binding rules
live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); this file is the directory index and the
reasoning behind those rules.

## Why the rules read the way they do

- **MCP as a second menu level.** The workspace MCP catalog is multi-select and
  unbounded, so it cannot sit in the footer selector row. Desktop has hover and
  opens a submenu; touch does not, so mobile pushes the panel onto the same
  surface with a back row.
- **The 20-row picker cap.** The complete option set is unbounded; the cap keeps
  the menu mountable while search still ranks over everything. The project
  picker uses `DropdownMenuSearchInput` for mount-owned autofocus and to route
  typing back to search after pointer movement focuses a project row.
- **Project context material.** The selected project and its Private segment use
  the same raised tokens as the machine and worktree controls above the composer.
  [Decision](../../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-27-project-context-pill-elevation.md).
- **Effective project access.** A project is only really shared when its machine
  is too, which is why the badge combines both bits instead of reading the raw
  project bit.
- **`onSelectionUrlSync` as replace.** With the URL mirroring composer steering, a
  sidebar project-row click is either an identical-URL no-op or an ordinary search
  change, never a history entry per keystroke.
- **Applying a "Recently used" row in two steps.** Setting the agent seeds that
  agent's per-agent defaults; writing model/options before `appliedTargetKey`
  names the new agent lets those defaults overwrite the row that was just applied.
- **Direct-authoring the accepted history entry.** The new conversation then
  renders the first message immediately, without waiting for room sync.
- **Workspace-scoped drafts.** The workspace slug scopes every part of a new-chat
  draft before the workspace id resolves. Every peer workspace window uses the
  same durable localStorage contract; its launch relationship and the selected
  project do not change draft ownership or lifetime. New-chat navigation selects
  a target but does not clear the draft; an accepted submit does.
- **Menu focus returning to the prompt.** Leaving focus on the model/agent trigger
  after Esc or an outside dismiss makes Enter re-open that menu.
- **The drop target living in `chat-landing-view.tsx`.** A session dragged from the
  sidebar writes a mention into the composer this layout renders, and nothing above
  it participates, so plumbing the handle up to `chat-landing.tsx` would buy
  nothing.
- Draft ACP preparation has a longer contract that remains in the private
  architecture context.
