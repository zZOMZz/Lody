# Product surfaces

Binding rules live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); this index explains ownership.
Child directories such as `sessions/`, `mobile/`, `chat/`, and `archive/` own their scoped rules.

## Sidebar and session rows

The sidebar spans `loro-sidebar.tsx`, `loro-app-sidebar.tsx`, `session-list.tsx`, and
`sidebar-*.tsx`. `sessions/session-list-rows.ts` resolves row relationships, while
`lib/session-opened-by-tree.ts` builds the presentation tree.

Section labels scroll with their rows, per the
[sidebar section scrolling Spec](../../../../specs/sidebar-section-scrolling.md).

GitHub repository groups and local project folders both expose a desktop drag handle.
Their orders are persisted per workspace; local project keys also include the owning
machine so projects from different devices cannot collide. See the
[sidebar project ordering Spec](../../../../specs/sidebar-project-ordering.md).

[Sidebar relationship rationale](../../../../.agents/docs/components-sidebar-session-tree.md)
explains why exact opener navigation and root-row indentation use separate ids.
A child Tab may open an independent Session: the row sits under the root, but its
navigation must still return to the precise creating Tab.

Updated organize mode is a mixed recency list. The sidebar view popover exposes
`Show Project` as a switch below the View and Tasks menu groups. It controls the
second line with folder / muted GitHub owner mark + project name. The complete
row acts as the Switch hover target, changing only the track color. It remains
visible but disabled in Project mode, with a right-side tooltip explaining that
it is available in Updated view. Touch users open the same hint by tapping the
disabled row, while keyboard focus also exposes it. GitHub owner marks keep
their original colors at a fixed 60% opacity in every row state. Nested opened
Sessions stay one title line so the 30px tree trunk still meets. Workspace-mode
Pinned omits the line.
Decisions:
[project context](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-20-sidebar-updated-project-context.md)
and [display preference](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-20-sidebar-updated-project-display-preference.md).

## Entry points and layout

- Sidebar footer: Help (`?`), Archive, Settings, in that order. Help retains the
  documentation, GitHub repository, community, GitHub Issues feedback, and bug-report menu; Archive is a direct
  button and becomes the return action while open. See the
  [footer Spec](../../../../specs/sidebar-footer.md).

- [Zen layout](../../../../specs/zen-layout.md): `AppCommands` dispatches the shared
  layout action; the mounted desktop Session publishes its right-panel controls.

- Sidebar Search, immediately below New Chat, opens the shared command palette
  through `lib/commands/palette-state.ts`; see the [Spec](../../../../specs/sidebar-search.md).
- Chat landing: `chat/chat-landing.tsx`.
- Browser desktop sign-in handoff: `login-page.tsx` under `?client_id=electron`,
  the page the desktop app opens in the system browser. A desktop sign-out leaves
  this browser signed in as the previous account, so the page names that account
  and transfers it only on an explicit choice, keeps the attempt's
  `state`/`code_challenge` when the user switches accounts, discards a transfer
  that lands after the switch, and renders the `lody://auth/callback` URL as a link
  beside the automatic navigation — a browser that refuses a custom-scheme
  navigation reports nothing back, so the link must already be on screen.
  [Decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-15-electron-browser-signin-account-choice.md).
- Desktop update prompt: `sidebar-update-banner.tsx` and
  `update-changelog-dialog.tsx`, driven by the pure selectors in
  `lib/electron-update-banner.ts`.
- Desktop safe areas: `web-workspace-layout.tsx` and
  `getWebWorkspaceLayoutRootClassName`. The iPad native shell renders the desktop
  layout (`detectAppDeviceClass()` is `tablet`, viewport >= 768) with
  `viewport-fit=cover`, which is why desktop top/side padding also matters there.
  The composer owns its bottom edge; a global bottom inset would double-pad it.
- Sidebar toggle: `WebWorkspaceLayout` retains the full-width sidebar, animates
  its transform and the adjacent content width together, and honors reduced motion.
  `SidebarVisibilityGate` pauses sidebar-only sources while hidden. Compact
  presentation and settings navigation can still remount it: `LoroSidebar` saves
  its viewport offset by workspace in `atoms/sidebar-state.ts` and restores it
  before paint. [Decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-26-sidebar-content-width-animation.md).

## Provider readiness

[`shared/agent-readiness-mark.tsx`](shared/agent-readiness-mark.tsx) draws the
provider's cold, arriving, and ready states in setup and onboarding. It owns its
StyleX sizes, tones, `surface="avatar"` onboarding variant, and progress orbit;
the indeterminate arc animates an HTML wrapper around the SVG to remain
compositable on Retina displays. The migration keeps the previous rendered
geometry and palette; its verification and the one product-theme colour bridge
are recorded in the
[StyleX migration note](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/simplification/2026-09-26-agent-readiness-stylex.md).

## Shared cues

The [conversation drop overlay](shared/conversation-drop-overlay.tsx) paints a
non-interactive mask over the active drop zone; the parent owns hit testing and
drag state. The [DeepSeek delegation warning](shared/deepseek-delegation-warning.tsx)
supplies the same linked warning contents to desktop and mobile run configuration.
The [MCP transport icon](shared/mcp-transport.tsx) supplies the transport glyph to
settings controls. Their visual rules are component-local StyleX, with the
overlay's light/dark alpha tied to the app's explicit theme. See the
[migration decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/simplification/2026-09-26-shared-cues-stylex.md)
for the visual-equivalence boundary.

## Session controls

The [workdir mode selector](shared/workdir-mode-selector.tsx) offers local and
worktree modes in a compact menu. The companion worktree checkbox pill uses its
flat `surface="context"` presentation in the chat landing composer. An
unavailable worktree remains visible with
its reason; after session creation the current mode is an inert, tooltip-named
value rather than a disabled action. The
[session relation card](shared/session-relation-card.tsx) presents opened/opened-by
provenance in the conversation and operation stream, with navigation enabled
only while its exact target is available. Both components own their visual
rules in StyleX; the [session-control decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/simplification/2026-09-26-session-controls-stylex.md)
records the preservation boundary.

## Conversation access

`session-sharing.tsx` holds the desktop header's access surface: the team
visibility copy (`getSessionSharingLabel` / `getSessionSharingDescription`), the
list-row `SessionSharingIndicator`, the `SessionArchivedBadge`, the team-share
confirmation dialogs, and `SessionAccessControl` — the one header control
carrying both team visibility and static publication.

Team visibility is resolved by `hooks/use-session-sharing.ts` over
`lib/session-sharing.ts`. Static publication lives in `sharing/`, with
`hooks/use-session-share-management.ts` owning the editor and its read-only
companion `useSessionShareStatus` answering the header's "already shared?".
`sessions/session-chat-interface.tsx` owns the editor instance both the control
and the "…" menu open. Rationale:
[header share control](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-09-14-session-header-share-control.md).
