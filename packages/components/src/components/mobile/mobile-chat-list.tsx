/* Exit animation tuned to feel like a row "falling out" of the list
   rather than vanishing: a height-and-opacity collapse paired with
   `layout` on every sibling so they slide up to fill the gap in
   lockstep. Rejected alternatives:
   - Spring on `height`: bouncy on a list-row collapse looks jittery,
     and the bounce ripples through every sibling's layout animation.
   - Slide-left out: that's already what super-swipe does for the row
     content; doing it again on the wrapper would be a double-slide.
   - Pure opacity fade: leaves a phantom gap until React commits the
     new layout — the collapse is what the user actually wants to see.

   Duration tuning (user reported 220ms read as "just disappears"):
   - 0.34s for height + layout — long enough that the eye registers
     the slot shrinking instead of just blinking out.
   - 0.34s for opacity matching the height curve — the previous 0.14s
     fade ended at frame ~140ms, so the row was already invisible by
     the time the slot finished collapsing. Sharing the duration with
     `height` keeps the fade visually tied to the collapse. */

         Keying on the archived flag forces a full unmount + remount of
