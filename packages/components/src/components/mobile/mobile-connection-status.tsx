/**
 * Mobile-only home-header status indicator, rendered as a PILL.
 *
 * The home header places this in an absolutely-centered overlay so the
 * pull-to-refresh / connection hint sits at true horizontal center of
 * the screen (see `mobile-home-screen.tsx`). The pill is
 * `pointer-events-none` so it never steals taps from the workspace
 * avatar or trailing glass discs; the caller also caps max-width so a
 * long label truncates instead of covering those controls.
 *
 * The pill keeps its own surface (card background + border + shadow +
 * blur) so it still reads as a distinct floating status rather than bare
 * glyphs loose in the chrome.
 *
 * One pill, every transient home-header status:
 * - connection: loading / reconnecting / offline, plus a green ✓ flash
 *   on a non-online → online recovery.
 * - refresh: a "刷新中…" spinner while a pull-to-refresh sync is in flight.
 * - pull hint: the 下拉刷新 / 释放刷新 arrow during an active pull drag —
 *   reusing the same pill so the user only ever sees one floating surface
 *   handing off between states (the pull hint and connection status can
 *   never double-stack).
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Renders nothing (the pill animates out) when there is no transient
 *   status to show — i.e. `state === 'online'`, not refreshing, no active
 *   pull, and no recent recovery flash.
 * - The whole pill springs in / out on appear / disappear; while it stays
 *   mounted, its inner content cross-fades between states so e.g. the
 *   loader → ✓ swap reads as a smooth transition rather than a jump.
 *
 * Every leading glyph carries `shrink-0` (the shared `Spinner` wrapper
 * does so itself). The pill is a capped-width flex row whose label
 * truncates, so without it a long label compresses the spinner to a
 * non-square box (measured 14×14 → 13.55×15.43 on the reconnecting label)
 * and the rotation then sweeps an ellipse — the glyph visibly wobbles
 * instead of turning in place. `index.css` also pins
 * `transform-box`/`transform-origin` globally for spinners; both are
 * needed, since that rule fixes the pivot but cannot restore a squished
 * box.
