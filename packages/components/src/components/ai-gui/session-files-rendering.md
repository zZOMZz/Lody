# Session files and image preview

File attachments use `file` blocks; the product contract is in
`specs/session-files.md`.

- `session-file-card.tsx` — pure card (icon by extension, name, size; pending/expired/
  previewable/downloadable derived from transport + `getServerNow()` expiry) and
  `SessionFileCardList` (adjacent-block aggregation). Story: `SessionFileCard.stories.tsx`,
  test: `tests/session-file-card.test.tsx`.
- Static shares pass `retention='publication'`: the copied object has no dependency
  on the source upload's expiry. Its manifest-gated reader decides availability.
- One card, one primary action — EXCEPT an HTML attachment, which also gets a separate
  download button for the source bytes. Its click opens the RENDERED page (browser
  surface or live file preview), a surface with no control of its own for the file that
  was uploaded; every other previewable file opens the preview dialog, which already
  downloads from inside, so it must not grow a duplicate control. That button carries the
  in-flight spinner, and the primary affordance keeps reading as preview.
- `session-file-preview-dialog.tsx` — `SessionFilePreviewPanel` (status-driven;
  markdown reuses `MarkdownRenderer`, raw toggle, copy=raw, truncation) and dialog wrapper.
  Story: `SessionFilePreviewPanel.stories.tsx`.
- `view.tsx` `SessionFileGroup` owns atoms/download/preview-fetch and resolves the pending
  machine name. Both render switches and `UserChatBubble` route `file` blocks through it.
  Upload/download/preview helpers: `@/lib/session-file-{upload,download,presentation}.ts`.
- Agent-uploaded blocks may carry a workspace-relative `sourcePath` proven by the CLI's
  containment check. It is provenance for reopening the live file, never a download path.
  HTML clicks use it only for same-machine Sessions and enter the existing rendered file
  preview. Remote HTML clicks reuse an active Browser connection; an available reported
  candidate requires an explicit confirmation before creating its tunnel. Missing provenance
  or preview state falls back to the ordinary attachment preview instead of guessing.
- `@/lib/session-file-download.ts` `downloadSessionFile` branches by platform
  (`isNativeAppShell()`): web/electron uses blob + `<a download>`; native mobile routes to
  `@/lib/session-file-native-save.ts` (Capacitor Filesystem chunked base64 write to the
  cache dir → Share sheet → best-effort cleanup; never buffers the whole file). Base64
  streaming math is in `@/lib/base64-chunk.ts` (tested by `tests/base64-chunk.test.ts`).
  Capacitor plugins stay dynamically imported so web/electron bundles remain clean.
- A group of image attachments is ONE wrapping row (`IMAGE_ATTACHMENT_ROW_CLASS` in
  `view.tsx`), used by `ImageGroupBubble` and the user row's grouped `image` items.
  Never give it a fixed column count or a max width: the thumbnail is a fixed square,
  so a `grid-cols-2` turned a thirteen-image turn into a two-wide tower that scrolled
  for screens. Tiles keep `shrink-0` (flex shrinks before it wraps) and hug the
  speaker's side. Decision:
  [image attachment row](../../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-15-image-attachment-row-wraps.md).

## Image-preview overlay (zoom / pan)

- **There is exactly ONE zoomable image surface in the app:**
  `../shared/zoomable-image-viewer.tsx` (`ZoomableImageViewer`, wrapping
  `react-photo-view` `PhotoSlider`). It owns pinch-to-zoom, double-tap/wheel zoom,
  drag-to-pan, and the top-right close button. Tapping the photo stays inside the
  pan/zoom surface, and vertical pulls do not dismiss it; close through the
  toolbar or backdrop. Both callers mount it:
  `view.tsx` `ImagePreviewDialog` (chat image blocks, gallery of the turn's images)
  and `../sessions/session-file-image-preview.tsx` (Code Collab file preview, one
  image). A new image surface must reuse it rather than hand-roll gestures —
  the two paths are required to feel identical.
- The file preview stays a fitted `<img>` inline and opens the viewer on tap.
  `react-photo-view` has no inline mode, and a hand-rolled inline zoom would be a
  second gesture implementation fighting Vaul drawer drag + the file browser's
  `MobileEdgeBackSwipeZone`.
- Inside mobile Vaul drawers, do not default the portal to `document.body`:
  Radix/Vaul treats body portals as outside the drawer, so touch/scroll can be
  blocked or fall through. Pass an in-drawer element as `portalAnchorRef`;
  `resolveImagePreviewPortalContainer` walks up to the real `[data-vaul-drawer]`
  (not the `data-vaul-no-drag` body wrapper, which is `display: contents`) and
  `useImagePreviewPortalNoDrag` marks the mounted portal root `data-vaul-no-drag`
  so Vaul does not take over pan/pinch gestures.
- `react-photo-view@1.2.7` is patched in root `patches/` to hard-clamp the MINIMUM
  pinch scale at `1` (no shrink-below-fit rubber band; max stays 6×). Do not replace
  this with an outer `overlayRender`/React state clamp; that fights PhotoView's touch
  state.
- One viewer, two presentations (`zoomable-image-viewer.css`): touch keeps the
  full-bleed overlay; desktop (`useIsMobile() === false`) gets a lightbox — the
  photo inset by a `transform: scale()`, a translucent + blurred mask
  (`maskOpacity`), a gradient top bar padded clear of the macOS traffic lights /
  Windows caption buttons with its controls centered on their line (y=23 / the
  36px caption strip), and no `1 / 1` counter for a single image. Never inset
  the photo by capping `width`/`height` (PhotoView centers the box IT sized, so a
  capped box lands off center) or by padding (it erases an image smaller than the
  inset).
- Right-click inside the viewer opens a NATIVE Copy / Save menu, Electron only
  (`../../lib/image-preview-export.ts` + `apps/electron/.../image-export-service.ts`).
  The image is a `blob:` URL, so main cannot download it: main pops the menu and
  the renderer sends bytes for the chosen action — PNG re-encoded through a canvas
  for the clipboard, original encoding for the save. Callers pass `fileName` on
  each `ZoomableImageViewerItem` for the save-dialog default. With no preload
  bridge the handler must not `preventDefault()`: web keeps the browser's menu.
- Still plain non-zoomable `<img>`, by scope not by accident: tool-call `image`
  content blocks in `view.tsx` and markdown images in `markdown-renderer.tsx`.
