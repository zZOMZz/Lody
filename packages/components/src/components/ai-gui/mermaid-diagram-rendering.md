# Mermaid diagram rendering

`markdown-mermaid-block.tsx` renders a closed Mermaid fence;
`use-mermaid-diagram-canvas.tsx` decides what a diagram in a message may do, and
`mermaid-diagram-viewer.tsx` owns the full-screen surface. A fence that is still
streaming stays an ordinary code block until it closes.
Binding rules live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); this file holds the invariants and
why they read the way they do. Coverage:
`tests/markdown-mermaid-fullscreen.test.tsx`.

## A diagram in a message is a still preview until it is clicked

- It NEVER captures an unmodified wheel, activated or not. The only wheel the
  markdown root consumes is a pinch (a ctrl- or meta-modified wheel) over the
  activated diagram; every other wheel reaches the conversation's own listeners
  untouched, which keeps the scroll engine's follow (`lib/conversation-scroll`) and outline
  jumps (`view.tsx`) working. An earlier bundled pan/zoom canvas took every wheel
  and turned a page scroll into a zoom; nothing may reintroduce that.
- Clicking a diagram with a mouse, pen, or the keyboard ACTIVATES it: that one
  diagram becomes a canvas, where a trackpad pinch (a ctrl- or meta-modified
  wheel) zooms around the pointer and a held button drags. Escape, a press
  anywhere else, or the full-screen viewer releases it while preserving its
  current pan and zoom. Reactivation resumes that view for the same rendered SVG.
  View state is local to the mounted diagram; replacing it starts a new view.
- Touch never activates: inline pinch would mean taking `touch-action` from the
  browser and reimplementing inertial panning for the phone case the viewer
  exists to serve. A tap opens the viewer, where touch can pan and pinch and the
  control bar provides a precise zoom fallback.
- The transform goes on the `<svg>`, which the block injects as raw markup and
  never writes to again, so a finger resting on a diagram still scrolls the
  conversation.
- Activation adds no outline or ring. The grab cursor indicates the active state.
  The full-screen viewer receives a clone with the inline transform removed and
  dimensions corrected for its scale; opening it leaves the inline view intact.
- Every key the canvas answers — Escape included — is read only while focus is
  inside the activated diagram. An activated diagram sitting further up the
  scrollback must not swallow the Escape that dismisses a dialog, nor pull the
  caret out of the composer. Leaving by keyboard releases the canvas, so
  "activated" and "focused" never drift apart.
- The click target, its `role`/`tabindex`, and the full-screen button's host are
  all found by a `MutationObserver` — a diagram appears only after the lazily
  imported runtime resolves, long after the component commits. The block's own copy/download controls stay reachable
  without hover, and the full-screen button joins them there.
- The observer marks a diagram ONCE. It re-runs on every mutation a streaming
  turn makes, and removing `tabindex` from a focused element blurs it in
  Chromium — which would drop an activated canvas out of the keyboard mid-turn —
  while rewriting `aria-label` re-announces it. Only a diagram that has
  disappeared is restored.

## The viewer is the only full-screen surface

- It replaced an earlier bundled full-screen overlay whose only exit sat at a raw
  `top-4 right-4` — inside a phone's status-bar inset — while its content layer
  covered the backdrop and swallowed every tap, leaving a touch user no way out.
  Its entry point is a button portalled into the block's action bar, beside copy
  and download.
- Controls are at least 44px and padded by the `--safe-area-*` variables, never at
  a fixed viewport offset. There is always more than one exit: the close button, a
  click off the diagram, and Escape. Stacking comes from `--z-image-viewer`, so a
  diagram opened inside a dialog lands above that dialog.
- A diagram that does not fit opens at NATURAL size and is panned. Scaling an
  agent's sequence diagram down to a phone screen turns readable labels into a
  grey texture; only a diagram that already fits is scaled up.
- A trackpad pinch arrives as a ctrl-modified `wheel`, which Chromium would spend
  on zooming the whole window, so the viewer takes that default and zooms the
  diagram around the pointer instead. The anchored point is restored by scrolling
  the surface, measured from the diagram's own box: the surface centres a diagram
  that fits, and that offset is not proportional to the zoom.
- Plain wheel scrolling stays with the surface's own scrolling. On touch screens
  the full-screen surface owns one-finger panning and two-finger pinch so a
  diagram can be inspected without zooming the page; a mouse or pen drag still
  pans by hand. The inline preview keeps the browser's native touch behavior and
  opens the full-screen viewer on a tap.
- Whether a click closes the viewer is decided by where the press STARTED, never
  by the click's target. Panning takes pointer capture on the surface, and pointer
  capture retargets the following `click` to the capturing element — so a plain
  click on the diagram arrives with the surface as its target and would otherwise
  dismiss the viewer the reader just opened.
- The full-screen surface sets `touch-action: none` only while it owns a touch
  gesture. A one-finger move changes the scroll offsets, and a two-finger move
  scales around the fingers' centre while following that centre's pan. The
  inline preview deliberately leaves `touch-action` alone so a message can still
  scroll naturally; tapping it opens this viewer.
