 * cannot be attached to a session in another — and prompt text must not appear
 * in another workspace either, so every part uses this workspace-scoped key.
 *
 * Keyed on the workspace SLUG rather than the resolved id: the slug is a route
 * param that is stable for the whole mount, while `useResolvedWorkspaceScope()`
 * reports `null` until the workspace resolves. A key that flips mid-mount would
 * strand whatever was added before it settled.
 *
 * `stateKey` identifies the user and landing surface. An alternate landing
 * surface may suffix it so it does not clobber the main draft. Pass that, not a
 * raw user id, or a suffixed surface would share this scope with the main landing.
