 * that only matter on hover, focus or click, yet each closed one still mounts
 * its Base UI root and parts with the row. Inside an unarmed boundary the
 * `Tooltip`, `Popover` and `ContextMenu` from `armed-overlays.tsx` render only
 * their trigger element (props merged as `render` would) and no content. The
 * boundary arms on the first pointer entry or focus, which always precedes an
 * interaction with anything inside it, and the real parts mount then.
 *
 * Outside a boundary the context is armed, so every other surface is unchanged.

 * returned handlers are spread on. Arming remounts the triggers inside (they
 * gain their Base UI parts), so it must never land inside a press: Chromium
 * drops the click when the pressed node is replaced before pointerup.
 *
 * - Pointer entry commits synchronously. React schedules a `pointerenter`
 *   update at continuous priority, which can otherwise commit between the
 *   pointerdown and pointerup of an immediate click.
 * - A press that starts on an unarmed boundary (no entry seen, for example a
 *   row scrolled under a still pointer) keeps the plain trigger: its focus does
 *   not arm, and arming waits until the press and its click are dispatched.
 * - A keyboard focus that arms the boundary is handed back to the same trigger,
 *   found by its position among the focusable elements.
