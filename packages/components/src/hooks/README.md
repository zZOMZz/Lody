# `src/hooks` — background

Binding rules for this directory live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); this file keeps
the reasoning behind them so the rules can stay short. It explains only the hooks
that carry an invariant — the directory itself is the list of hooks.

## Session submission

`use-session-actions.ts` binds admission, analytics, and Jotai observations to
`lib/session-submission.ts`. The latter owns the ordinary Promise entry points
for creation, initial history, continuation, dispatch, and guide. It has no React
lifetime or second writer. The workspace journal durably accepts the full input before releasing the
composer, prepares attachments on Send, and serializes same-session submission.
`use-session-preparation` holds an owned warmup lease; attachment takeover cancels
and joins it. See the [attachment draft Spec](../../../../specs/session-files.md).

## Session lifecycle

`use-session-actions.ts` reads archive, restore, and archived-root deletion targets
through `WorkspaceRuntime.readSessionOperationTargets`. The runtime owns source
readiness and the Repo snapshot; the hook checks runtime identity before writing
through its captured writer. UI projection lag cannot change the target set.
Later-created Sessions fall outside that snapshot, and accepted writes are not
rolled back after a later failure. Exact deletion and ordinary Tab close bypass
discovery. The [relation Spec](../../../../specs/session-relations.md) owns cascade
and failure semantics.

## Default conversation draft

`use-empty-session-draft.ts` materializes the empty conversation URL sentinel only
after metadata hydration. It reuses an existing local draft or inserts one before
selecting its URL; replayed effects must not create duplicate drafts. It never owns
mobile viewer selection or creates a shared Session.

## Horizontal wheel scrolling

`use-horizontal-wheel-scroll.ts` is the one owner for converting a plain vertical
mouse wheel into horizontal movement. It uses a non-passive native listener because
React delegates wheel events passively, and releases native horizontal gestures,
browser zoom, nested content selected by the caller, and movement at either edge.
Compact tab strips use this behavior so their delta-mode normalization and edge
handling cannot drift.

## Workspace membership refresh

The cross-domain Better Auth `updateSession()` action returns `void`: it notifies
the session store synchronously. Chaining `.then()` crashes after a successful
ownership transfer, before organization permissions refresh. The membership hook
therefore calls it directly and separately notifies `$activeOrgSignal`. Its tests
use the plugin's actual action so a Promise-returning mock cannot hide this error.

## Conversation scrolling

The conversation viewport is owned by the conversation scroll engine
(`lib/conversation-scroll`, rules in its `AGENTS.md`), which replaced
`use-sticky-scroll.ts` and the Virtua list after seven fixes to the same blank-pane
class. Why and how: the
[scroll-engine note](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-27-conversation-scroll-engine.md).
`scroll-debug-log.ts` still keeps a geometry-only timeline
(`window.__lodyScrollLog.dump()`; console output with
`localStorage['lody:debug-scroll'] = '1'`), and the engine keeps an always-on cycle
log (`window.__lodyScrollEngineLog.dump()`).

`use-conversation-stream-items.ts` keys readiness and the visible hydration range by
`factSource ?? view`. Accepted-history projection wrappers may change while the
underlying conversation stays the same; resetting on wrapper identity would discard
an off-tail reading window. A new underlying source, even with the same session id,
must pass initial loading again. Before the first viewport report, the window is the
retained tail plus the turn of the engine's restored reading anchor, so a restored
position opens on real rows instead of placeholders.

The rendered body set belongs to the reading window, the retained 40-turn tail,
and native text selection. Other consumers may hydrate the same cache for facts,
search or outline previews, but those bodies remain placeholders in the stream.
Keeping the entry tail leased prevents the first narrower viewport report from
making already displayed rows evictable. Selection publishes retained turn IDs
before a scroll-driven window change; releasing selection removes that exception.
A loaded user predecessor still supplies assistant configuration even when its
own rendered row is a placeholder. See the
[background hydration decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-22-background-hydration-render-window.md).

## `useWorkspaceBadge`

`workspaceBadgeAtom` derives an absolute count from complete active-session metadata
and fresh presence, sharing the sidebar's parent/child activity summary. The elected
workspace window publishes changes immediately, reasserts the snapshot every 30 seconds,
and reconciles on focus or visibility restoration. The interval reads the current atom
and never restarts because the count changed; failed IPC gets another opportunity even
when the authoritative count stays zero. Main replaces contributions, and removes stale
ones on renderer crash/reload or window close. See the
[desktop window contract](../../../../specs/desktop-windows.md).

## `useStableSession`

A single HTTP 401 can be a stale response, so it is verified once against the
current credential; only a second 401 for the unchanged local token proves the
session is gone. Native login writes its Capacitor credential and the local token
non-atomically, so `nativeSignInInProgressAtom` fences the window between the first
sign-in request and successful page replacement. Timeouts, 5xx, and
`Client disconnected` are transport failures: signing out on them would eject a user
whose session is fine.

## Workspace catalog hooks

`use-agent-role-schema-reconciliation.ts` runs from the ready workspace shell's
window owner. It silently reconciles owned Roles after fresh, matching runtime
probes, without requiring the Role editor. Repeated startup is idempotent; offline
targets and failed probes remain retryable. See the
[reconciliation Spec](../../../../specs/agent-role-schema-reconciliation.md).

The workspace catalog is ONE small document, but a consumer mounts for every visible
session plus every hidden child tab and side chat, so per-mount leases multiply room
joins and duplicate row maps for a single list — the same problem
`use-machine-flock-rows.ts` ref-counts away. The shared snapshot is also
identity-stable across mounts, which is what lets the selection and composer-menu
memos built on it actually hit.

Catalog `upsert`/`remove` resolve on durability because a dialog that awaited the
upload sat open for the whole round trip, and the row it had already written showed
up in the catalog underneath it — so the open create form reported its own name as
taken (`resolveAgentRoleNameCheckExemption`) moments before closing on success.

Hiding a private Agent Role in the UI is not an access check, and an availability
rule copied into a component is one that can drift into a silent fallback; both stay
in the shared `listAccessibleAgentRoles` / `resolveAgentRoleAvailability` helpers.

## `use-session-doc.ts`

Session history snapshots are state, not an event log. Rendering every intermediate
ACP/CRDT snapshot can queue minutes of React work behind a long active turn and
retain every obsolete history tree, so history-only bursts coalesce to the latest
snapshot once per animation frame while control state stays synchronous.

## `use-app-store-review-prompt.ts`

The stored list of the newest 50 completed-turn timestamps answers the whole
threshold — if the oldest of the newest N is already outside the window then fewer
than N are inside it — and its last element doubles as the watermark that makes a
repeated history scan idempotent. That replaced v1's list of up to 512
`sessionId:turnId` strings re-serialized on every completed turn, and it is why the
recording effect can pass the whole outcomes array instead of diffing against a
per-mount observed set.

Because that watermark is a stored timestamp, no stored time may be in the future:
turn times come from the agent machine's clock and `nowMs` from the phone's, so a
stored future value would swallow every genuinely newer turn until real time caught
up. Future input is deferred rather than lost (the next history update re-scans the
session), and stored future times are dropped so a phone clock corrected backwards
heals on the next turn. The scheme under-counts by design: a session opened older
than the watermark does not backfill, which can never manufacture eligibility.

StoreKit already caps the sheet at three per device per 365 days, so a second rate
limiter here only makes the prompt unreachable — exactly what v1's active-day and
72h-any-failure gates did. StoreKit reports nothing back and every gate is
device-local, so `mobile/app_store_review_prompt_requested` / `_blocked` are the only
evidence that the path works at all. A candidate turn arrives on every completed
turn, so an undeduplicated `blocked` event would be among the noisiest in the
product, while deduplicating on the user alone would let the first gate mask the
rest.

## Code Collab file-index hooks

Owner-session resources are borrowed from the workspace-owned Effect `ScopedCache`
so that opening, scanning, subscribing, and joining happen once per session rather
than once per React mount. A recreated cache resource restarts its local revision
counter, which is why resource identity is part of provider memoization.
Local-machine RPC snapshots seed the shared resource before it becomes visible, so
first paint stays local while later Flock events remain deduplicated.

## `use-safe-area-insets.ts`

`DropdownMenuContent` and `PopoverContent` run this hook even when closed, so a
session switch mounts hundreds of subscribers. A per-instance `getComputedStyle`
would force a full-document style recalculation after the commit dirtied style.

## `use-keyboard-navigation.ts`

A session switch renders synchronously for longer than the key repeat interval, so a
held shortcut would otherwise queue renders nobody sees. The one-navigation-per-
painted-frame rule is a frame budget, not a time-based debounce.

## `use-lody-live-activity.ts`

`atoms/doc-meta` republishes the session and agent-config arrays once per flushed
batch, so a cold start reset the 250ms timer before it ever fired while every batch
still paid for a full summary rebuild — hence the leading-edge throttle on the input,
anchored to the last emit. The permission candidate is a fresh object per scan, so
depending on it re-runs the payload memo every render.

The 250ms bridge debounce stays for a different job: a flush lands in the commit
after the change that requested it, and without the debounce the bridge gets both,
the stale one marking the alert shown so the fresh one is dropped by the
already-alerted early return.

`iosLiveActivitiesEnabledAtom` defaults to true, so without the native-shell check
every desktop build would rebuild a summary it can never show. The activity id is
derived outside that gate so the disable and unmount paths can still end an activity
the payload no longer describes.
