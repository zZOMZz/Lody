# Shared UI helpers and file surfaces

Edit `AGENTS.md`, not its `CLAUDE.md` symlink. Rules also bind callers changing
crash recovery, caches, files or IPC typing.
Rationale: [components](../../../../.agents/docs/components-package.md) and
[file paths](../../../../.agents/docs/components-file-paths.md).

## Electron IPC types

- `electron-ipc-client.ts` may import `ElectronIpcServices` from main-process
  registration with `import type` only. Browser/mobile bundles must erase the edge;
  never add an Electron runtime/package dependency or allow Node APIs in shared UI.
- Keep `experimentalDecorators` and the direct catalog-pinned `@types/node` dependency
  for the source declarations. Service classes and their single constructor list own
  invoke signatures; never duplicate them in a handwritten contract, spec, or one-for-one
  platform port. Fix resolution/erasure at this boundary or reconsider caller ownership.
  Push events and one-way sends stay in `@lody/shared/electron-ipc`.

## Crash recovery and diagnostics

- `ErrorBoundary`'s `error-boundary-fallback.tsx` displays the real error and one-click
  full-report copy on every build. Details default visible (`showErrorDetails` opts out);
  `lib/error-boundary-report.ts` is the pure copy builder.
- Error/not-found screens use `components/status-page.tsx`; pre-React `boot-failure.ts`
  draws that column in plain DOM with copied V2 token values, never React/StyleX/Tailwind.
- Crash screens never reload/restart/reset themselves. `resetKeys` must not clear a captured
  error; the copyable fallback stays visible until the user presses a recovery button.
- A cloud query throws into render and keeps throwing. An optional surface inside a larger
  boundary owns an inline `ErrorBoundary`, so a backend failure degrades locally instead of
  replacing the host subtree.
- `lib/clear-local-cache.ts` owns `markCacheClearPending` (recoverable `lody*` caches,
  still signed in) and `startHardReset` (full wipe/sign-out with its own confirmation
  dialog). Defer asynchronous deletes to next boot; clear synchronous storage BEFORE
  writing the boot flag.
- Cache-level clearing uses an explicit localStorage DELETE list, never a keep-allowlist.
  Include connection caches (Streams JWT/gateway, cursor-bypass markers, workspace-info
  map); register new `lody:*` cache keys there. Auth tokens and preferences survive.
- Include the tail of `lib/session-render-trace.ts` in copied reports. Its module-level
  ring records render/mount/navigation, collapsing consecutive duplicates into ×N.
  Writers append one compact diagnostic line, never drive behavior from the trace;
  surface mount/unmount uses a layout effect.
- `maybeClearLodyCacheOnBoot` runs once at most per page load, shared by `AppInitializer`
  and `RuntimeProvider`; the latter awaits it before opening repo IndexedDB.
- Mount `stuck-connection-banner.tsx` once in `MainLayout`. After 45s of continuous
  control-connection `loading`, offer the same cache-clear flow; never interrupt,
  retry, or time out the connection attempt.

## File Preview and Code Collab

- Remote file surfaces read the owner-session file-index Flock. Local Electron targets
  load initial file trees and All Changes from the local `code-collab/get-file-index`
  Machine RPC snapshot without awaiting Flock, then subscribe to local Flock events.
  Subscription delay/failure cannot block IPC or trigger cloud fallback. Allow stale
  join events to converge with the CLI's asynchronous snapshot reconciliation.
  Machine RPC also serves exact content, save, LSP, and diff requests.
- `openFile` uses File Preview v3 plain reads: no workspace watch, All Changes recompute,
  or Flock publish. Local Electron uses IPC-only `file/resolve-local`, negotiated via
  `localFileResources`; unresolved routes never fall back to Streams RPC. Electron
  serves local file resources; remote targets retain restricted, bounded `file/preview`.
- Small local text may enter the full-document editor/cache. `paged-text` is a separate
  readonly snapshot with bounded random reads; never seed the save cache, executable
  HTML, rendered Markdown/SVG, or full-document copy/download from it. Hidden paged
  viewers abort reads; virtual rows and one page bound memory independently of file size.
  Binary local previews carry resource URLs, never base64. Binary results, local or
  remote, never enter the text-open cache.
- The index is a hint, never an open gate: send unindexed paths to the machine, and
  leave `unavailableReason` unset for `binary` entries. Force `external: true` results
  readonly regardless of the index; saves stay inside the session workspace.
- Validate file-index rows with shared Zod helpers; preserve structured lazy-directory
  entries so `@file` completion initializes directories before refreshing results.
- Turn-scoped diffs come only from the CLI-local evidence store, never current disk,
  All Changes, or the removed v1 capture. File/diff reads retain cross-render in-flight
  limits; active requests release slots only on settlement.

- Preview and More-menu shell actions share `useSessionFileActions`. Only Electron
  on the session's own machine may invoke them; explicit local absolute artifact
  paths stay absolute, and remote paths never launch on the viewer's machine.
- Native file sharing uses complete authorized preview bytes, never a remote host
  path. Keep the existing transfer limits; stage each export in an isolated cache
  file and clean up after cancellation, failure, or handoff.

## File identity, caching, and errors

- `session-file-open-target.ts` alone owns path normalization. Canonical workspace-relative
  paths (tree, quick open, mobile browser, LSP) travel verbatim. Only Markdown hrefs
  are URL-decoded and stripped of `:<line>` / `#L<line>` suffixes, absolute host
  roots; same-machine Electron preserves other worktree paths instead of stripping
  `.../worktrees/<uuid>/` prefixes. Display shortening never rewrites click targets.
  Line anchors travel as fields, not inside paths.
- Cache resolved opens under BOTH `response.path` (the save identity) and the requested
  path (viewer/change-check identity). After save, refresh EVERY `cacheKeys` alias.
  Preview reads are case-tolerant; `save-text` writes are case-exact.
- Before reason mapping in `session-file-error-state.tsx`, classify "outside the workspace"
  as a policy rejection, not filesystem "Access denied"; CLI keeps that exact phrase.
  Classify "owner session mismatch" as a startup race and advise "try again".
- Known gaps and their repair constraints: [path provenance and skipped entries](../../../../.agents/docs/components-file-paths.md#known-gaps).
  When repairing skipped entries, distinguish directory read failures and account for
  `openFile` retaining index `readonly`; an openable result must not become uneditable.

## Dropped files and folders

- `file-drop.ts` splits one OS drop into `files` and `directories` by
  `webkitGetAsEntry().isDirectory`; a folder is never an upload candidate.
  `dropped-local-path.ts` is the ONE path bridge (Electron
  `webUtils.getPathForFile`, absolute, forward-slash); web/mobile have no path,
  so a directory drop inserts nothing. A drop commits all paths together via
  `mentionActionsRef.insertPathMentions`, with one `dir` range per path. Preserve
  POSIX and Windows drive roots (`/`, `C:/`) during normalization and insertion.

## ACP dispatch

- Automatic Role cleanup requires a fresh matching runtime schema and owner access.
  Persist through a conditional writer transaction; never overwrite intervening edits
  or clear model/permission pins. See [intent](../../../../specs/agent-role-schema-reconciliation.md).

- Display every provider-supplied rate-limit window name with localized duration via
  `formatAgentRateLimitWindowLabel`, even when duration/utilization/reset match.
- Before creating top-level or child sessions, call `filterAcpSessionConfigOptionValues()`
  so cached values outside the current selector schema are neither dispatched nor persisted.

Attachment transfer lifecycle changes follow [workspace ownership](../providers/AGENTS.md#attachment-transfer-ownership).
