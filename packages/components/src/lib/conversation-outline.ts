/**
 * The left-rail table of contents for a session conversation: one entry per
 * ROUND (a user turn plus everything the agent did in response), so a reader
 * can see where they are and jump between turns.
 *
 * Two hard constraints shape this module, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **It derives from `items`, never from the DOM.** The conversation is a
 *     `virtua` virtual list that only mounts rows near the viewport, so an
 *     IntersectionObserver / element-registration design (shadcn's
 *     `MessageScroller` approach) would simply miss every off-screen round.
 *     Reader position instead comes from Virtua's index math — see
 *     {@link resolveActiveOutlineIndex} and its caller in `ai-gui/view.tsx`.
 *
 *  2. **It must stay cheap during streaming.** `items` gets a new identity on
 *     every streamed delta, so the outline is rebuilt at token rate. Per-message
 *     memoization ({@link digestByMessage}) keeps that to one WeakMap hit per
 *     message; see {@link SUMMARY_SOURCE_WINDOW} for why the markdown cleanup
 *     never runs over a whole assistant answer, and {@link reuseConversationOutline}
 *     / {@link reuseOutlineAnchors} for why the arrays keep their identity. The
 *     same lesson is already recorded in `hooks/use-incremental-search-blocks.ts`,
 *     where full-history text extraction per delta had to be made incremental
 *     and chunked.

 *
 * `offset` must already be in Virtua's ITEM-offset space. The conversation
 * viewport has top padding, so its `scrollOffset` is not; the caller measures
 * that delta once. See `ai-gui/view.tsx`.

 * to start above the viewport top" stops being the round the reader is in: the
 * final rounds are usually shorter than the viewport, so the scroll clamps and
