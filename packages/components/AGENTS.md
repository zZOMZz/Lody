# `@lody/components` contributor guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md` also applies.

This package contains shared React UI for browser-shaped, Electron, and responsive
mobile surfaces. Background for the rules below:
[.agents/docs/components-package.md](../../.agents/docs/components-package.md).

## General rules

- Regenerate TanStack routes after changing route files.
- Use `pnpm --filter @lody/components dev` to generate and format the route tree
  with Oxfmt before CI compares it with the committed file.
- Add Storybook coverage for new presentational components and meaningful states.
- All user-visible copy must go through i18n.
- Compact number units (K/M/B vs 万/亿) follow the product language via
  `toIntlLocaleOrEn` / `formatCompactNumber`, never the host OS locale.
- Use `@lody/ui` primitives for every control; never restyle one through `className`
  (a StyleX or Tailwind visual class there loses to, or fights, its own). Legacy
  primitive rules: [src/ui/AGENTS.md](src/ui/AGENTS.md).
- New or rewritten product styling is StyleX, not Tailwind. Colour, shadow, radius and
  space come from `@lody/ui/tokens/colors.stylex` / `scales.stylex`; styles live in the
  component's `stylex.create`, and what an area shares lives in its `surface.ts`
  (e.g. `components/settings/surface.ts`). Copy that follows `--ui-font-size` keeps `em`.
  Materials are `@lody/ui`'s: cards lift, controls stand up, every value holder is
  the one recessed well, and a list of records is one card with ruled rows.
- `PlatformContext` intentionally has no default. Cloud-shaped component tests use
  `tests/test-platform.tsx`'s `TestCloudPlatformProvider`; plain-module tests install
  and remove the exact platform port they need.
- Shared UI accesses optional hosted operations only through descriptors in
  `src/lib/cloud-api-operations.ts` and `@lody/platform/react`. Never import generated
  backend declarations or call a hosted database directly.
- A descriptor marked `public` can run before authentication and must expose only an
  intentionally public or narrowly token-scoped DTO.
- Renderer and worker builds that cannot use native top-level await must use
  `vite-top-level-await-fixed.ts`. Do not bypass its audited-version assertion.
- Keep accidental weight out of the test module graph: Vitest re-evaluates a
  file's whole import graph per test file. Do not re-export a heavy leaf from
  `src/ui/index.ts`, deep-import `date-fns/locale/<tag>` rather than the barrel,
  and keep the icon-asset `new URL` glob alone in
  `src/components/icons/file-icons/asset-url.ts` so the test alias can replace
  it. Rationale and measurements:
  [module graph note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-09-10-components-test-module-graph.md).
- `vitest.config.ts` deliberately omits `vite-plugin-top-level-await` and
  `vite-tsconfig-paths`; `vite.config.ts` keeps both because the product bundle
  needs them. The plugin reads `tsconfig.vite.json`; keep the type-only React
  mappings from `tsconfig.json` out of the runtime resolver. Run the suite with
  `NODE_ENV=test` — a `production` value resolves React to a build without `act`.
- System theme state, persistence, and browser preference tracking are owned by
  `next-themes`. Keep Lody's wrapper focused on preview state, fixed VS Code theme
  application, and the Electron native-theme bridge.
- Never `@source`-scan a third-party component library in `src/tailwind/index.css`:
  it emits that library's utilities globally. Konsta's `last-child-hairline-b-none`
  (unanchored `:last-child … ::after`) made every portal open/close restyle the whole
  app. Keep `#root` off `<body>`'s tail (`lib/body-tail-sentinel.ts`, mounted by
  `routes/__root.tsx`). Rationale:
  [portal restyle note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-23-portal-full-restyle.md).
- Sidebar session-row lists use `SIDEBAR_ROW_LIST_CLASS` (`content-visibility: auto`,
  which also applies paint containment): a row must draw inside its own box (inset
  focus rings; connectors inside the leading slot). Recursive GitHub trees go through
  `lib/repo-file-paths-cache.ts`, never a direct `githubFetchFilePaths` per search.
- Layout-level components never subscribe to high-frequency atoms (presence and its
  clock, all sessions): host such hooks in a leaf that renders nothing
  (`LodyLiveActivityHost`) and read sidebar navigation state at key time. Sidebar rows
  are memoized: keep item and live-status identity while unchanged and pass
  selection-independent handlers, or every row re-renders on each switch or tick.
- A context over the conversation or the sidebar keeps a stable value (stable callbacks,
  sets keyed by content): each new value makes React walk the whole subtree. An
  `AnimatePresence` around such a subtree sets `presenceAffectsLayout={false}` unless it
  drives `layout` animations; otherwise its context changes on every parent render.
- Dark-theme brightness ceiling (`vscode-theme-css.ts`): every text foreground token is
  held at the interface ceiling (13:1 on the canvas); only prose (`text-reading`,
  14.6:1), `text-foreground-strong` (headings, bold), the selected sidebar row and the
  active tab go above it. Unselected sidebar text uses `text-sidebar-row-foreground`. Never hard-code
  white text on theme surfaces. Hover changes a row's fill, never its text color.
- Sidebar top-level groups (machines, GitHub Worktrees, Chats) all use
  `SIDEBAR_GROUP_LABEL_CLASS`, with no leading icon or sticky positioning; labels scroll
  with their rows. Project, repo and conversation rows
  are 1em. A machine is identified by its Offline pill and hover card
  (`sidebar-machine-card.tsx`); never show "offline" while its status is unknown.
- `@lody/ui` colours come from the VS Code theme: `theme-provider.tsx` puts
  `lib/vscode-theme/lody-ui-palette.stylex.ts` on the root in the resolved mode. Override
  its tokens there with `createTheme`, never with Tailwind classes on package parts.
- Components rendered inside conversation rows take `Tooltip`, `Popover` and `ContextMenu`
  from `ui/armed-overlays.tsx`, not `@lody/ui`: inside an unarmed `useInteractionArm`
  boundary they render only the trigger element until the first hover or focus. An
  owner-opened overlay still mounts, focus that arms a row is handed back to the same
  trigger, and arming never commits inside a press (Chromium drops the click).
- Markdown code blocks tokenize in `lib/markdown-highlight.worker.ts`; the main thread
  keeps only cache hits and the no-worker fallback. Builds without an `es` worker format
  alias `@/lib/markdown-highlight-worker` to a null shim (see site-docs).

## Rules shared by callers

Before changing crash recovery, diagnostics, localStorage cache keys, file preview,
Code Collab, file/diff caches, or Electron IPC typing, read the corresponding section
of [src/lib/AGENTS.md](src/lib/AGENTS.md). These contracts bind all UI, hooks, and
provider callers, not only files under `lib/`. Recovery must preserve auth/preferences
at cache-clear level; local file routes must never silently fall back to cloud.

## Scoped rules

- Product surfaces, sidebar session rows, local projects:
  [src/components/AGENTS.md](src/components/AGENTS.md).
- Shared primitives, emoji picker, field colors, diff viewer:
  [src/ui/AGENTS.md](src/ui/AGENTS.md).
- Hooks: [src/hooks/AGENTS.md](src/hooks/AGENTS.md). Workspace runtime, transports, and
  presence: [src/providers/AGENTS.md](src/providers/AGENTS.md).
- Sessions, mobile, chat, mentions, onboarding, settings, and Codex reset
  forecast each own an `AGENTS.md` under `src/components/`. Commands and shortcuts:
  [src/lib/commands/AGENTS.md](src/lib/commands/AGENTS.md).
