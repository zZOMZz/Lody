# Electron contributor guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root rules apply. For `src/**`, read module, IPC and window contracts in
[`src/AGENTS.md`](src/AGENTS.md).

## Local OSS composition

- The public desktop composition is local-only. It must not discover deployment env
  files, initialize authenticated product-cloud behavior, or enable telemetry.
- The build-time `mainPlatformKind` is the source of truth for data directories,
  sockets, run/lock files, host leases, and workspace catalogs. Pass it explicitly;
  never infer it from an inherited `LODY_PLATFORM` value.
- The Vite toolchain mode is named `oss`, while the injected product platform remains
  `VITE_LODY_PLATFORM=local`. `electron.vite.config.ts` owns this mapping and must
  clear caller-provided `VITE_*` values before injecting audited local constants.
- Run desktop development from the repository root with `pnpm start:local`. It must
  rebuild the embedded CLI and local renderer before launching the bundled CLI; do
  not reuse production/cloud artifacts.
- Cloud desktop development must likewise build and sync the CLI before
  `electron-vite dev`; the direct `apps/cli/dist` lookup is only a missing-staging
  fallback and must not let an older `resources/cli` shadow a fresh build.
- Turning off **Run local agent** is an explicit cloud control-only mode: do not
  probe an embedded or externally started CLI, and keep the local Loro data-plane
  relay disconnected until the setting is enabled again.
- `localPlatform.getSnapshot` atomically supplies the persistent `local:*` user and
  the single `lw_*` workspace from the CLI catalog. Do not split this into independent
  fallbacks. A missing catalog means provisioning; malformed identities or multiple
  active workspaces are errors.
- OSS local mode must not create a PostHog client, write an analytics install id, or
  upload source maps, even when unrelated analytics variables exist in the shell.
- Use `pnpm --dir apps/electron preview:local` only when a smoke/E2E harness has
  already prepared and validated the OSS build artifacts. That low-level command must
  remain `--skipBuild --mode oss`.

## Build toolchain and window identity

- `desktop-bootstrap` must be the first main import: Nightly chooses its data
  directory before auth stores open. `desktop-channel` changes desktop identity,
  never the shared CLI namespace, data root, or Host endpoint.

- Electron 39's Chromium supports native top-level await. Keep renderer and module
  worker builds on native TLA; do not add `vite-plugin-top-level-await` or an
  equivalent full-bundle AST compatibility rewrite. Reprocessing Rollup's complete
  output graph materially increases production renderer peak memory.
- Linux window identity is one contract: the composition's packaged `desktopName`,
  electron-builder's `syncDesktopName`, the pre-ready `app.setDesktopName` value,
  and the AppImage runtime desktop entry must all resolve to the same desktop-file
  basename. KDE uses that identity to associate Wayland/X11 windows with the
  installed icon.

## Embedded CLI and native dependencies

- The embedded CLI runs built JavaScript, never source-loader/Jiti. Development
  and packaged builds share the output layout.
- `better-sqlite3`, `@lydell/node-pty`, and `loro-crdt` remain external and must be
  staged under `resources/cli/node_modules` by `scripts/sync-cli-dist.mjs` and
  `scripts/cli-native-deps.mjs`.
- `@lydell/node-pty` and `better-sqlite3 >= 13.0.2` use N-API artifacts. Stage the
  target platform/architecture artifact; do not rebuild by Electron ABI.
- Every embedded-CLI descendant launched through `process.execPath` must inherit
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` when it exists. On packaged macOS, omitting it launches a
  second GUI app instead of Node.
- Those descendants load runtime-installed native addons that carry no Team ID, so
  macOS nested binaries keep `disable-library-validation` in
  `build/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist`. Removing it makes every such `dlopen` fail
  and the host reports only `ACP connection closed`. Top-level app entitlements stay
  strict.
- Electron Builder ignores nested staged `node_modules`. `eb-after-pack.mjs` must copy
  them into `app.asar.unpacked`, assert the DeepSeek adapter plus all four pinned
  presets, then probe CLI `--help`, node-pty loading, and a real in-memory SQLite
  database before signing.
- Keep `better-sqlite3 >= 13.0.2`, the Node-API 10 engine range
  (`>=22.14.0 <23 || >=23.6.0`), the first-import guard in
  `sqlite-runtime-support.ts`, and its tests aligned. Older runtimes can segfault
  while loading the binding. Linux armv7 is unsupported.
- When upgrading `@lydell/node-pty`, audit package layout and Windows ConPTY binding
  names. Apply the staged asar-path repair after downloading target artifacts; a pnpm
  patch cannot cover cross-architecture packages fetched during packaging.
- `electronLanguages` must include underscore names used by macOS resources and
  hyphenated names used by Chromium `.pak` files. The after-pack assertion for
  `locales/en-US.pak` is a release gate.

## Release packaging and auto-update

- Always package through `scripts/package-electron.mjs` (`pnpm run package -- <args>`),
  never `electron-builder` directly. It injects the released version via
  `extraMetadata` so `package.json` is a fallback rather than the release source of
  truth, and it forces `--publish never` unless a caller opts in.
- Windows/Linux electron-updater still uses the `publish` block: Vite strips every
  `VITE_*` value, so `AppUpdaterService` falls back to packaged `app-update.yml` and
  `latest*.yml`. Tag contract is `v${version}`.
- macOS uses Sparkle (`electron-sparkle-updater`): `SUFeedURL` + `SUPublicEDKey` in
  Info.plist, `package-electron.mjs` rebuilds the native addon, afterPack injects
  `SPARKLE_ED_PUBLIC_KEY` before signing. Tag releases contain changelogs only;
  they do not build installers or generate Sparkle feeds/deltas. Sparkle load
  failure falls back to electron-updater. Sparkle UI stays silent; progress and
  ready-to-install go through `ElectronUpdaterState` for the renderer banner.
- Linux `.deb` installs go through `app-updater-linux-install.ts`, never
  electron-updater's `DebUpdater`: its `spawnSync` freezes the main process for
  the whole polkit prompt, which no JS-side timeout can interrupt. Spawn
  asynchronously, quit only after a zero exit, and treat a signalled installer
  as a failure rather than the success `spawnSync` reports. AppImage needs no
  privileged helper and stays on electron-updater.
- A downloaded package outlives a failed check or install. While
  `downloadedFile` is set, `recordError` keeps `phase: 'downloaded'`; dropping
  to `error` hides the sidebar banner and the About install button, which are
  the only ways to retry.
- Artifact names must stay space-free. GitHub Releases rewrites spaces to periods,
  which desynchronizes `latest*.yml` and Sparkle enclosures. Do not use
  `${productName}` in `artifactName`.
- macOS releases must be signed and notarized. `generate_appcast` refuses archives
  that fail `codesign --verify --deep --strict`, and Gatekeeper needs a notarized
  first-install DMG. Windows and Linux do not have this constraint.
- `snap` stays in the target list for local builds and needs snapcraft on the machine.

## Verification

- Claimed warm windows stay hidden until matching content readiness. Main owns the
  recovery deadline; do not cover a visible window with a blank surface. Restore
  background throttling after preparation and replenish the spare after show.

- Cloud browser login is owned by main: PKCE attempts, callback exchange and replay
  handling must not depend on a renderer. Organization failures never roll back
  authentication. Windows subscribe then read revisioned snapshots. Contract:
  [desktop browser login](../../specs/desktop-browser-login.md).

- Run the repository checks after source changes. Packaging/native-dependency changes
  also require the Electron packaging probes for every affected target architecture.
- Do not replace deterministic probes with launch sleeps or retry-only tests.
