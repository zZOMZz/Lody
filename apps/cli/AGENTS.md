# CLI Agent Guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md` applies; this file adds CLI context. Build, PR-poller, and adapter background:
[.agents/docs/cli-overview.md](../../.agents/docs/cli-overview.md). Scoped rules live under
`src/{agent,commands,session,mcp,orchestration,preview,lib}`.

## Build and packaging

- The Node 22 bundle uses native top-level await. Do not run a browser TLA
  compatibility transform over its output chunks. Validate the CLI SSR build
  under `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=2048`; increasing the heap is not a fix.

- The public CLI defaults to the local platform, discovers no deployment dotenv files, and must
  never initialize telemetry in local mode even if PostHog variables exist in the shell.
- INVARIANT: the dev output layout must match production's — `index.js` plus flat sibling
  `claude-acp.js` / `codex-acp.js` / `*-worker.js` — because worker owners resolve their child by
  FILENAME next to `import.meta.url`. Keep npm packages external by ABSOLUTE path, keep
  `splitting: true`, and keep the no-hoisting assertion.
- Import the CLI's own `version` from `@/pkg`, never a relative `../package.json`; the package
  `name` stays `lody` in every composition.
- Optional desktop provenance comes from the compiled constant in `utils/desktop-build.ts`,
  never runtime environment variables. File/hybrid log initialization records it at debug level.
- Keep `prepare:acp-adapters` before `dev-build.mjs` and Vite: skipping it can silently launch old
  adapter capabilities from a stale `dist/`.
- `engines.node` is pinned to `>=22.14.0 <23 || >=23.6.0` by better-sqlite3's
  `NAPI_VERSION=10`, and
  `src/utils/sqlite-runtime-support.ts` must stay the FIRST import in `src/index.ts` — older Node
  segfaults on the SQLite binding instead of throwing.
- Read [apps/electron/AGENTS.md](../electron/AGENTS.md) — embedded packaging, native deps/ABI,
  child runtime env, and the three places the Node pin moves together — before changing runtime
  deps, bundle externals, or spawning `process.execPath` with a filtered environment.

## State paths

- INVARIANT: name the state root with `getLodyDataDir()`/`ensureLodyDataDir()`, never literal
  `~/.lody` — only those honor `LODY_DATA_DIR` and the OSS `.lody-oss`, so a literal join names a
  sibling that may not exist. Create it before a path inside reaches git or an ACP cwd; git reports
  only `fatal: Invalid path '<data dir>'`. A path derived from a stored host path keeps THAT path's
  separator — shape decides, never `process.platform` — since `dotlodyPath` crosses machines and
  two spellings of one dir never match
  ([note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-14-lody-data-dir-path-root.md)).

## Coding rules

- Prefer Effect TS idioms for new/refactored CLI code — services via `Context.Tag` + `Layer`,
  typed errors, structured concurrency, `Schedule` retries: context/cli-effect-ts.md.
- Keep the strict tsconfig, no `any` or non-null assertions, and Zod at every foreign boundary:
  context/cli-type-safety.md.
- After a remote prompt arrives, only correctness-critical setup may block before ACP
  `agent.prompt`; never await notifications, analytics, or UI summaries
  (context/cli-prompt-hot-path.md).
- Startup order and timing traces: context/cli-startup.md.
- The daemon file log always keeps `debug`, so a per-token or per-tick `logger.debug` evicts the 20 MB
  rotation window. Move it to `logger.trace` (`LODY_LOG_TRACE=1`) only if its subsystem's failures
  stay diagnosable without it; keep failing/slow branches at `debug`
  ([note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-16-daemon-log-volume.md)).
- File logs use `createFileTransport`; a raw `DailyRotateFile` makes a full disk crash the daemon.
- Read context/local-agent-ownership.md before changing local ports/sockets, daemon PID state,
  Electron/daemon startup, Supervisor retries, or Worker shutdown; health probes are observation
  only and never authorize PID killing.
- Read context/terminal-output-lifecycle.md before changing ACP terminal notification handling or
  history compaction.

## Cross-entry agent contracts

Before changing MCP tools or their callers, read
[src/mcp/AGENTS.md](src/mcp/AGENTS.md) for Session acceptance, reply bounds, and
execution/consent rules. These rules also bind CLI callers outside that directory.

- Child Sessions are one level deep. An independent Session created inside another persists exact
  provenance in `openedBySessionId`, plus `openedByRootSessionId` when the opener is a child Tab;
  never rewrite the exact opener to the root or treat either as `parentSessionId`.
- INVARIANT: reasoning effort and fast mode are per MODEL, because an ACP probe's `configOptions`
  describe only the model current at probe time. Validate effort against the TARGET model using
  `AcpCapabilityCacheEntry.modelReasoningEfforts` and skip the resulting `validatedConfigIds` in
  `validateTurnConfigOptionValues`; dispatch what cannot be checked offline as requested. Keep
  runtime rejections in debug diagnostics: Codex/Claude mismatches for model, effort, Fast, or Plan
  never become visible `agent_warning` notices, while other rejections still do. Claude Fable
  models omit Fast, so `fast=false` is skipped as a no-op while `fast=true` is dispatched.
- INVARIANT: `SessionManager` publishes `exit`/`terminated` only for `Session` instances a caller
  received. `MessageHandler` treats them as "the live turn's agent died" and finalizes the turn, so
  a `createAgent` failure detaches the instance BEFORE its cleanup `terminate`; otherwise a
  recovery such as the resume-to-replay fallback loses every update of the replacement agent
  ([note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-11-failed-session-create-lifecycle-events.md)).
- `lody feedback` and MCP `lody_feedback` submit only caller-provided suggestion text plus CLI
  version, platform, and architecture — never cwd, paths, hostname, environment, logs, prompts,
  history, or file contents. Keep obvious-secret rejection in the CLI and the hosted API boundary.

## Agents, GitHub, and PR status

- Checkout branch observations belong to `session/workspace-git-service.ts`, independent of
  GitHub/PR support. Publish to the workspace owner, serialize probe plus write, and keep
  startup/file snapshot observation off the prompt/RPC critical path.

- ACP authentication rules: [src/agent/AGENTS.md](src/agent/AGENTS.md). A capability refresh after
  login proves credentials became usable and must finish inside the renderer's 300-second deadline.
- Agent `gh` auth for GitHub repo sessions is set up in `src/session/session-manager.ts`; the
  host-side credential-broker INVARIANT is in [worktree](src/session/worktree/AGENTS.md).
- Built-in provider auto-registration (`src/lib/lody.ts`) must wait for initial meta sync and a
  confirmed `syncMachineFlockDoc()` before `hasAgentConfig`/`createAgentConfig`, or a stale local
  doc creates duplicate configs; unconfirmed sync keeps a deferred backoff retry.
- `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` is a capability-bearing launch input: digest its exact value into the
  DeepSeek capability source version and thread the Agent config environment through every
  probe/session source-version derivation, so two endpoint catalogs never share a cache identity.
  Never put the API key or a derivative of it in that cache key.
- Pi extension scanning runs only the pinned runtime's read-only listing entry under a frozen
  default or saved-profile environment — never caller-supplied launch fields. Selections
  require the pinned extension-aware runtime (`piExtensionsProtocolVersion`), not a fallback.
- `src/lib/pr-poller/` compensates for a broken hosted GitHub webhook → Streams fan-out. Keep
  policy in its pure modules with a thin scheduler, keep priority driven by presence and
  `lastMessageAt` rather than a turn-end hook, and keep only scheduling state (never PR status) in
  `~/.lody/pr-poller-state.json`. Spec: `specs/pr-status-reconciler.md`; invariants:
  `src/lib/pr-poller/AGENTS.md`.
