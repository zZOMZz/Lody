/**
 * Fails fast, with a readable message, on the two runtimes where better-sqlite3 >=13
 * cannot work. Both are narrowings versus better-sqlite3 12, and neither one otherwise
 * surfaces as anything resembling "unsupported runtime".
 *
 * 1. Node-API floor. 13.x is built with `NAPI_VERSION=10` (its binding.gyp), and
 *    Node-API 10 landed in Node v22.14.0 / v23.6.0. Loading the binding on anything
 *    older **segfaults** — no exception, no output, exit code 139. better-sqlite3 12's
 *    per-ABI prebuilds shipped one `node-v127` build covering all of Node 22.x.
 *
 * 2. 32-bit ARM. 13.x resolves `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>.node` and ships x64/arm64
 *    only; since 13.0.2 dropped the install script there is no source-build fallback
 *    either. 12.x published `linux-arm` and `linuxmusl-arm`, so armv7 used to work.
 *    Without this check the failure is `Cannot find module
 *    '.../better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node'`, which reads as a corrupt
 *    install and invites endless reinstall attempts.
 *
 * `engines` covers neither case: npm only warns on a mismatch unless `engine-strict`
 * is set, and npx does not enforce it at all.
 *
 * Node-API is read from `process.versions.napi` rather than the version string because
 * that is what the addon loader actually gates on, and it stays correct under Electron
 * (Electron 39 reports napi 10 on Node 22.22).
