# apps/cli/src/agent

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

ACP client side of the CLI. Responsibilities per file and background: [README.md](README.md).
Protocol: context/acp-protocol.md; edit-payload quirks:
context/acp-agent-edit-evidence.md; adapter repos: [apps/cli/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

## `agent-client.ts`

- Consume Core extensions via `agentCapabilities._meta.lody`, session `_meta.lody`, and
  `_lody/...`. Provider/pre-Core readers stay in `lody-acp-extension.ts`; consumers stay neutral.
- Grok Always Approve uses `allow_once`, never lasting grants; pending calls drain through
  the durable permission flow on accepted config changes. Questions remain interactive.
- Builtin Grok must default `clientCapabilities.terminal` to false.
- ACP file reads map native `ENOENT` to `RequestError.resourceNotFound`; preserve
  other failures and session validation rather than returning empty content.
- Send the driving turn's config on every session establishment as `_meta.lody.sessionConfig`;
  provider-specific startup translation belongs in the ACP adapter. `session/set_config_option`
  stays the live-session switch, and a successful selection becomes a later replacement's
  startup state.
- Cache session `_meta.lody.modelReasoningEfforts`; Codex `model[effort]` only.
- Project config from setup, `set_config_option` responses, and `config_option_update`.
  Present `configOptions` (including `[]`) replaces the snapshot; only omission falls back
  to the requested value, updating both replacement startup state and `currentValue`.
- Convert Core `_meta.lody.goal` epoch seconds to durable milliseconds here, and normalize
  `limited` to the durable `blocked` status.
- Keep both built-in `lody` MCP transports. INVARIANT: MCP tools must not run inside the
  daemon process.
- MCP HTTP: loopback bind plus bearer token; on Linux prove the peer socket's uid via
  `/proc/net/tcp{,6}`, REJECT an unprovable peer, and refuse to start when it is
  unreadable. `LODY_MCP_HTTP_DISABLED=1` forces stdio. The stdio config is an explicit env
  allowlist, never inheritance: keep `LODY_AUTH_URL`, `LODY_AUTH_SITE_URL`, and
  `LODY_SERVER_URL` so cloud MCP orchestration uses the daemon's deployment, let local platform
  assembly clear them before agent startup, and never add CLI credentials or secrets.
- Pass the same MCP config on initial and replacement DeepSeek Harness sessions.
- Workspace MCP resolution stays TWO phases: call `loadExternalMcpServers` BEFORE `initialize`,
  never between `initialize` and `newSession`.
- Acknowledged steer ends `applied`, `not-applied`, or `unknown`. Only adapter proof maps
  `not-applied`; transport/process ambiguity stays `unknown`. Await the request answer even
  after the turn response; Session execution never classifies provider errors.

## Launch and runtimes

- `acp-runner.ts`: spawn + initialize + `newSession`/`loadSession` go through
  `acp-session-start-gate.ts` (default 2, `LODY_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACP_SESSION_STARTS`). Never bypass
  that gate.
- Builtins use `setting.ts`'s `resolveACPProcessLaunchAsync()`. [Codex profiles](../../../../specs/codex-account-profiles.md)
  forbid upstream keys in shared/child env. Process records delay deletion, never
  restrict same-profile concurrency.
- `deepseek-harness-runtime.ts` is NOT managed: no download, prefetch, override, or
  auth integration. Preserve logical npx argv for recovery; Windows uses npm's JS
  entry without cmd.exe. Keep npm, the forwarder, DSH and native Job children
  windowless without changing stdio, environment or containment. npx installs the
  closure; `dsh --profile` uses `process.execPath` with inherited `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`.
  Credentials stay in env, never config. Model/reasoning use the Agent request
  waterfall; permissions use Harness presets; `agent_preset` uses
  `AgentPresets.mount/recompose`, never UI-only state.
  Presets change only before the first prompt. Per-Agent ACP stdio/HTTP MCP
  belongs in the adapter, not host composition. JSONL encoding detection
  is READ-ONLY: fail mixed roots naming both paths; never modify artifacts.
- `managed-agent-runtime.ts`: Codex/Claude/Grok pins come only from their
  `<name>-runtime-manifest.json`; reject dependency/manifest version mismatches and never
  duplicate pins beside the manager. Do not loosen the metadata
  schema or accept unknown legacy fields. Definition drift is a miss; cleanup and update scans are best effort. The Grok submodule is never the source for production
  runtime binaries, and the desktop must not depend on the Kimi submodule workspace. Custom
  methods stay capability-gated. Inject the artifact base URL from
  `CloudPort.runtimeArtifacts`; never read deployment environment or derive the channel here.
  `LODY_RUNTIME_BASE_URL` is an explicit mirror override only.
- Install cancellation, here and in `acp-binary-manager.ts`: concurrent installs share one
  download but keep independent consumer leases; cancelling one caller must not stop others, and
  only the last aborts fetch, checksum, and extraction. An immediate retry waits for an aborted
  generation's scratch cleanup and never reuses it meanwhile. Tar and ZIP extraction must attach
  to the shared abort signal; ZIP cancellation destroys the yauzl endpoint, awaits the
  relay/output pipeline, and fences cleanup on the reader's real close/error event — never await
  the yauzl endpoint, whose `destroy()` does not settle.
- `npx-cache.ts`: ACP `npx` spawns force `npm_config_cache`/`NPM_CONFIG_CACHE` to the active
  profile's `npm-cache`. Automatic `_npx`/`_cacache` cleanup is allowed ONLY for that Lody-owned
  cache.

## `acp-authentication.ts`

- The per-agent slot covers preparation and the child; cancel/timeout wins through cleanup,
  terminates the process, and releases Retry. Stop the process before success.
- Authorization data must never enter logs, chat, Flock, or config; raw provider output and
  secret defaults must never reach retained progress.
- Claude capability refresh runs its native status command first so missing credentials surface
  as structured auth-required state before adapter startup; explicit environment-authenticated
  paths bypass it.
- Registry/custom initialization advertises no terminal capability; only agent-driven methods
  are runnable (`env_var` rejected as deprecated, `terminal` unsupported until Machine RPC has a
  real interactive-terminal bridge). Method lists and elicitations stay on the original
  long-running request with one pending interaction at a time; replies carry an interaction id
  and use the encrypted authentication-input path on remote Machines. Bound URL schemes, sizes,
  ids, labels, options, and defaults before they enter progress, under a shared serialized-byte
  budget for the form.
- Machine RPC may name only a persisted Provider `configId`; the daemon freezes
  machine/CLI/agent/launch/env/runtime fields before spawning, capability refresh included, and
  later replies can never replace that launch target.

## Capabilities and titles

- `getStaticBuiltinAcpCapabilities()` applies only to `cliType: 'builtin'` without runtime
  overrides. `machine/acp-capabilities-refresh` is always a real runtime probe, cached per
  `agentConfigId` and the launched runtime version; an aborted probe must NOT update
  the cache, and requests/responses carry that id to keep configs of one provider isolated.
  `ManagedRuntimeUpdateCoordinator` never hot-swaps a running ACP process, and Machine Flock
  writes ignore `fetchedAt` when comparing entries.
- Core `sessionTitle` v1 transfers title generation to the live ACP process after
  initialization; tagged `generated`/`explicit` updates qualify, never `fallback`/`unset`.
  Legacy managed Claude/Codex/Grok retain ownership without runtime overrides;
  only Claude/Grok trust untagged titles. Sanitize internal instructions and preserve
  user-set titles. Contract: [session titles](../../../../specs/acp-session-titles.md).
- NEVER derive a git ref from prompt text: refs reach the remote and no filter proves a
  prompt secret-free. Worktree sessions keep `session/<id>` unless the agent renames it.
