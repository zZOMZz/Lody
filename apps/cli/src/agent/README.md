# apps/cli/src/agent

ACP client side of the CLI: spawning coding agents, talking the Agent Client Protocol to
them, resolving their runtimes, and authenticating them. Binding rules for this directory
live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); this file is the responsibility index and the background a
reader needs to place a change.

Protocol reference: context/acp-protocol.md. Per-agent edit-payload quirks:

## Files

- `agent-client.ts` — the ACP connection: initialize/session lifecycle, client
  capabilities (fs, elicitation), permission/fs request handling, update callbacks. Lody
  ACP extensions are consumed through `acp-extension-core`, so capability discovery lives
  at `agentCapabilities._meta.lody`, session metadata at `_meta.lody`, and custom methods
  use the Core `_lody/...` names. Session initialization advertises Core answer notes
  alongside standard form elicitation; the shared Ask Question bridge retains the
  selection and separately keyed note through durable permission history.
- `acp-runner.ts` — process spawn/restart around the client. Spawn + initialize +
  `newSession`/`loadSession` share `acp-session-start-gate.ts`.
- `acp-session-start-gate.ts` — process-wide start semaphore used by
  `Session.createAgent`, `startLocalAcpAgent`, and history-catalog ACP spawn.
- `setting.ts` — launch resolution for every agent kind, including the pinned
  `npx --prefer-offline -y dimcode@0.5.10 acp` builtin. Dimcode reuses the
  profile-owned npm cache and startup recovery; credentials remain in its own
  configuration or provider environment.
- `deepseek-harness-runtime.ts` — Harness-home (`DSH_HOME`, then `~/.dsh`), atomic-config,
  and npx launch wrapper around the `packages/acp-extension-dsh` submodule. It converts
  the adapter entry to a file URL for Cordis ESM imports, including Windows drive paths,
  while preset and session directories remain filesystem paths. Its Windows bootstrap
  suppresses child consoles inside npm and DSH, including the pinned native Job
  runner; [compatibility scope and verification](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-22-dsh-windows-console-popups.md).
- `managed-agent-runtime.ts` — pinned Codex/Claude Code/Grok native and Kimi Node-package
  `.tar.zst` artifacts, checksums, resumable downloads, the active installation profile's
  `agent-binaries` layout, and best-effort `bin` symlinks for complete native CLIs.
- `acp-authentication.ts` / `acp-authentication-output.ts` — the authentication lifecycle
  and the incremental conversion of bounded provider output into allowlisted authorization
  URLs, device codes, expiry, and Claude's optional browser-returned code input.
- `acp-binary-manager.ts` — registry binary-distribution agents (tar/zip install).
- `npx-cache.ts` — npx cache isolation plus poisoning detection/purge for resilient
  registry launches.
- `acp-capabilities.ts` / `acp-startup-monitor.ts` / `acp-analytics.ts` — capability cache,
  startup health, analytics.
- `login-shell-env.ts` — login-shell env capture for spawned agents.
- `fixtures/` — synthetic test fixtures.

## Background

### ACP file errors

`fs/read_text_file` maps a missing local file to ACP resource-not-found (`-32002`).
Other I/O errors propagate, and session validation runs before file access. Provider
filesystem adapters translate that protocol error to their engine's native missing-file
semantics. In particular, Kimi may enter Plan before a plan file exists; reading its
status must retain the distinction between an absent file and an unreadable one.

### Grok permission handling

Grok's TUI combines the runtime YOLO setting with client-side `AllowOnce` responses.
`lody-acp-extension.ts` owns this compatibility rule for builtin Grok only;
`agent-client.ts` evaluates it against the accepted session config and exposes config
subscriptions. `MessageHandler` persists the selected outcome in the existing permission
history. Enabling Always Approve also drains already waiting requests and clears their UI
state and subscriptions. New requests without `allow_once` stay interactive; the queue
drain cancels such requests, matching the TUI without creating lasting grants. User
questions and other providers do not participate. The Grok adapter passes native requests
through so this durable flow remains their single owner.

### ACP start concurrency

Unbounded concurrent Codex starts each spawn a lody.exe adapter, a Codex app-server, and a
lody.exe MCP child; they contend on `~/.codex` and freeze every in-flight session until
Lody restarts. Hence the shared start gate (default 2,
`LODY_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACP_SESSION_STARTS`).

### The built-in `lody` MCP server has two transports

Agents whose initialize response advertises `mcpCapabilities.http` get a shared HTTP
endpoint served by ONE host subprocess per daemon (`src/mcp/lody-mcp-http-host.ts`,
supervised by `src/mcp/lody-mcp-http-server.ts`); everything else keeps the per-session
stdio entry. The supervisor keeps token and port stable across host restarts because
sessions bake the endpoint into their MCP config at creation; while the host is down, new
sessions silently fall back to stdio.

MCP tools do synchronous SQLite work (`orchestration/operation-store.ts` restricts that to
subprocess boundaries) and one-shot workspace-manager work, either of which would stall the
daemon event loop — which is why they never run inside the daemon process.

On Linux the HTTP host proves the peer socket's uid via `/proc/net/tcp{,6}` because the
bearer token leaks through the agent runtime's `/proc` cmdline there, so failing open would
void it.

Builtin DeepSeek Harness mounts the stdio server per ACP session through the extension's
native `dsh-mcp-client` bridge; the bridge owns namespace collision handling and releases
the MCP child with `session/close` or Agent teardown.

### Workspace MCP resolution is two phases

`loadExternalMcpServers` (catalog sync + document read) runs BEFORE `initialize` so its
remote round trip overlaps spawn and the handshake, and the selector it resolves to applies
the agent's advertised `http` capability at `newSession`. Awaiting the load between
`initialize` and `newSession` would put a remote sync — up to its 5s budget — on the
critical path of every session establishment while the agent process sits idle.

### Steer delivery classification

AgentClient converts adapter evidence into `applied`, `not-applied`, or `unknown`. The
applied-waiter must wait for the steer request's own answer before giving up on the upstream
turn's response: Codex may finish the interrupted turn before returning its definitive
`failed` response. A closed connection, a dead agent process, or an internal error stays
`unknown`, because the prompt may already be inside the live turn. Session execution consumes
this outcome without interpreting provider errors or interruption state itself.

`pendingPromptCompletion` aggregates raw prompt requests and request-transport steer
submissions, even after a caller stops waiting locally. The session owner drains these before
reuse or confirms termination of the old execution. A prompt response alone cannot release
an unresolved steer submission. Application leases are released even if history projection
fails; ending a local waiter never manufactures a provider refusal.

### DeepSeek Harness is not a managed runtime

`deepseek-harness-runtime.ts` publishes Lody's content-addressed ACP profile beside (without
replacing) user Harness config and launches the pinned package closure through
`dsh --profile`. The generated profile composes `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` with a Lody overlay
that disables the product telemetry, request-inventory, and LLM-title rows, so the host keeps
the upstream base composition without inheriting the web product surface. Never compose the
product app bundles, and install every launcher package as an exact `name@version` (the Cordis
ecosystem rides its own releases). CLI production and dev
builds copy the extension's pinned official presets beside `deepseek-acp.js`; the generated
roster also discovers `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets`. The host mounts Harness's file settings
provider for `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml` (default `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`); refresh provider
capabilities after editing the model catalog. An explicit `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` still uses
the endpoint's `/models` list rather than local catalog additions. Harness JSONL roots are single-encoding
stores: an empty or zstd root uses upstream's `zstd`, a raw-only legacy root keeps `none`,
and a mixed root fails with both paths named.

On Windows, both session and probe/title spawns resolve the selected npx shim from
the final child PATH and execute its adjacent `node_modules/npm/bin/npx-cli.js`
with Lody's Node. This keeps the full pinned closure out of `cmd.exe`, whose
8191-character limit is smaller than the package argument list. Native executable
shims remain direct launches; a script shim without the standard npm entry fails
with an actionable error instead of falling through to another installation.
Cache isolation, startup budgets, and retries still see the original npx command
and arguments; conversion happens after those policies, on each spawn attempt.
See the [Windows command-length fix](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-21-dsh-windows-command-length.md).

### Managed runtimes

Codex version/archive pins come from `codex-runtime-manifest.json`, which the outer
`mirror:agent-runtimes` operator command atomically refreshes from the exact official GitHub
Release when the adapter's `@openai/codex` dependency changes. Claude SDK/runtime archive
pins come from `claude-runtime-manifest.json`; the mirror derives sources and integrity from
the adapter lockfile, regenerates all eight zstd archives after a version change, verifies
the canonical production objects, and then atomically updates the manifest.

Grok launches the pinned `acp-extension-grok` compatibility adapter with an official,
unmodified R2-managed runtime in `GROK_PATH`. Archive, executable, and source integrity
pins live in `grok-runtime-manifest.json`. Version changes regenerate all six targets
from exact official npm metadata; the operator updates this manifest only after full
production upload/readback. The CLI rejects adapter/manifest version drift. See the
[automatic pin refresh decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-09-25-grok-pin-refresh.md).
The submodule owns the private-wire contract
and minimum official version. Kimi is different: `packages/acp-extension-kimi` owns the
Lody-maintained runtime source and implements the shared `acp-extension-core` contract.

Completed caches written before metadata schema v1 remain reusable through a separate strict
legacy schema; their old `name`/`version`/`platform` fields are normalized in memory and only
the trusted runtime definition's command and host requirement are inferred. Repacked Node
packages intentionally publish no convenience link because non-ACP subcommands may be
omitted. A fully validated install that has already crossed the final complete-marker commit
may remain a safe cache hit even though that caller observes cancellation, and network
failures retain the URL plus nested transport cause for diagnostics.

### Authentication

Which authentication path runs is decided by the provider, not the caller: a managed builtin
runs its pinned login command, and everything else (registry and custom ACP) opens a
temporary standard ACP connection in the same bounded lifecycle. Kimi runs `acp --login`;
Grok runs the official `login --device-auth`; Claude Code runs the official
`auth login --claudeai` subscription flow. Codex ChatGPT runs official
`login --device-auth`; managed API profiles use the existing secret-input interaction
and a tools-free Responses probe. [Account profiles](../../../../specs/codex-account-profiles.md)
owns isolation, generation rotation, concurrency and compatibility guarantees.

Remote Web transport stores only an ephemeral-ECDH/AES-GCM envelope in the 24-hour request
stream; the target machine keeps the recipient private key in memory and decrypts
immediately before stdin. Local UI and CLI state is in memory. Raw output progress remains
only as a temporary old-renderer compatibility field.

Grok and Codex authentication requirements come from ACP session creation because
`codex login status` cannot account for custom model providers with
`requires_openai_auth = false`. Because protocol authentication spans launch preparation,
JSON-RPC requests, and process cleanup, the running slot also carries an `AbortController`
that termination raises before any child exists.

The real-process authentication test keeps method selection, versioned secret metadata, form
submission, URL parsing, protocol stdout integrity, and process cleanup on one spawned ACP
connection.

### Capability cache

Default managed builtin Codex/Claude/Kimi/Grok capabilities come from
`getStaticBuiltinAcpCapabilities()` in `@lody/shared` so onboarding, settings, and chat can
render mode/model/config options without spawning adapters or downloading managed runtimes.
DeepSeek's static entry mirrors the bundled adapter's model, reasoning-effort, and permission
selectors. Registry/custom agents and builtin runtime overrides still need the actual ACP
agent.

`machine/acp-capabilities-refresh` resolves the pinned target, then the most recently
installed reusable runtime, and blocks on `ensureCurrentRuntime()` only when no runtime is
installed. `ManagedRuntimeUpdateCoordinator` serially downloads stale targets in the
background and never hot-swaps a running ACP process. Real session creation also normalizes
its `NewSessionResponse` through `acp-capability-normalization.ts`; the session execution
service schedules a non-blocking cache update before the first prompt. Adapters may publish
per-model reasoning-effort ladders on that session response as
`_meta.lody.modelReasoningEfforts`. Normalization merges the map into the cached
`modelReasoningEfforts`, together with the legacy `model[effort]` id derivation for builtin
Codex only — other agents use the same brackets for unrelated variants (Claude's `opus[1m]`
is a context window). Vendor model `_meta` never enters the CLI.

Capability cache versions are freshness markers, not read barriers. A newer client continues
to render understood fields from an older daemon's parsed entry while scheduling a replacement
probe; likewise, an older client may use the understood portion of a newer entry. Runtime
override entries still apply only when their source-version suffix matches the selected override.

### Session titles

Providers advertising Core `agentCapabilities._meta.lody.sessionTitle: { version: 1 }`
own automatic title generation. After the main ACP session initializes, dispatch
uses its live capability to skip `title-generator.ts`; capability cache freshness
cannot cause a duplicate process on the first launch. Probes and normal session
creation persist `sessionTitle` for the settings dialog, including runtime overrides
and custom providers. A custom command's cached source must match before hiding
its title settings.

`session_info_update` with `_meta.lody.titleSource` `generated` or `explicit`
feeds the existing sanitized, conditional title write. Fallback/unset or malformed
tags are rejected; user titles are preserved. The generated tag requires the
capability. Legacy explicit tags remain compatible. Failed provider generation
leaves the draft title; there is no timeout-triggered duplicate generation.

The builtin Claude/Codex/Grok identity table remains compatibility for older
managed runtimes. Overrides revoke that fallback, but can independently advertise
the new capability. Only legacy Claude/Grok titles are trusted without a tag.
See the [contract](../../../../specs/acp-session-titles.md) and
[original compatibility decision](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-08-acp-owned-session-titles.md).

The daemon does not name branches. A worktree session stays on the `session/<id>` branch
`worktree-manager.ts` created for it. [WorkspaceGitService](../session/workspace-git-service.ts)
observes branch changes independently of GitHub; its lifecycle and activation triggers are
defined by the [checkout branch contract](../../../../specs/workspace-branch-state.md). For GitHub projects the agent is asked to do exactly that — see
`GITHUB_WORKTREE_SYSTEM_COMMANDS` in `session/session-execution-helpers.ts`.

This used to be an automatic prompt-to-branch rename, removed because it could not be made
safe. A branch name is a ref: it reaches the remote as soon as the session opens a PR, so
deriving one from prompt text publishes prompt text, and "rotate the password before Friday"
is an ordinary request. Two filters were tried and both failed for the same reason — a secret
has no reliable shape, since `hunter2` is a password and an ordinary word. Stripping
credential-shaped tokens left everything that did not look like one; failing closed on
credential _syntax_ still let plain prose through, so it fails open on every miss and cannot
be a security boundary. Naming refs after user text needs a source provably isolated from the
prompt, and no such source exists at session-ready: the ACP title has not arrived yet, and the
isolated generator's own fallback is the raw prompt.

### Local project identity

For local project sessions, `SessionManager` supplies a resolver for the original
root in the local project catalog. `Session` and `createAcpClient` carry it to
`AgentClient`, which invokes it only after the adapter advertises Core
`worktreeProject` version 1 and the final execution directory has been claimed.
The resolved metadata accompanies new/load/resume/fork and replacement sessions;
ACP cwd remains the actual worktree. This also covers local child sessions,
whose execution directory comes from their parent but whose project identity
comes from the local project record. GitHub-only and projectless sessions do not
send a local project identity. See the [draft contract](../../../../specs/local-project-acp-identity.zh.md).
