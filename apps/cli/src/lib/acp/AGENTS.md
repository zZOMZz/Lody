# apps/cli/src/lib/acp — ACP notification → session history

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.
Root `AGENTS.md`, `apps/cli/AGENTS.md`, and `../AGENTS.md` also apply.

`history.ts` owns `handleACPUpdateMessage`, per-toolCallId enrichment, and
edit-evidence extraction; `history-apply.ts` owns the CRDT history writes. Protocol
reference: `context/acp-protocol.md`; per-agent payload quirks:
`context/acp-agent-edit-evidence.md`.

## Ownership is bound at enqueue time

Negotiated Core subagent events retain root/run ownership through the shared
history reducer. Enrich child tools per `(sessionId, runId, toolCallId)`; root
permission mirrors must not duplicate child edit evidence. Child turn IDs never
replace parent turn IDs. Disconnect marks live runs unknown and incomplete.
Child edit evidence resolves its committed run's assistant entry, including when
a later parent turn flushes it; unregistered child tools publish no evidence.

Validated task-lifecycle `_meta` snapshots survive history filtering while running
and merge by taskId — `_meta.lody.task` and Devin's `cognition.ai/subagent_*`
markers alike. They are lifecycle facts, not repeated terminal output; never
drop them under the generic intermediate-tool snapshot compaction rule.

Devin `cognition.ai/subagent_context`-tagged non-tool updates for a known subagent
are dropped in `AgentClient.sessionUpdate` BEFORE usage/config/title consumers;
tool updates continue so permission-requested rows and edit evidence still
resolve in history.

Machine RPC `session/cancel` with `subagentTaskId` forwards only to the native
AgentClient for the exact active parent turn. It never marks the parent cancelled
or falls back to whole-turn Stop. The machine advertises subagentCancellation v1.

ACP updates must be bound to assistant-entry ownership when they are enqueued, never
by asking for "the current turn" during flush. `../session-transient-store.ts` stores
`assistantEntryId` / `userTurnId` / `turnEpoch` on each buffered update, and
`history.ts` exposes explicit assistant-entry versus autonomous append APIs. It must
not silently create uuid entries for unowned output; that is what prevents
bad-network retry tails and duplicate dispatch from rendering the same agent turn
twice.

## Root scheduling tools are the one `rawInput`/`rawOutput` exception

INVARIANT: In the root transcript, `history-apply.ts` strips `rawInput`/`rawOutput` from ALL generic tool
calls (they are unstructured by spec) EXCEPT the four scheduling tools in
`SCHEDULING_TOOL_NAMES` (`CronCreate` / `CronDelete` / `CronList` / `ScheduleWakeup`,
matched via `_meta.lody.toolName`). For those, the small `rawInput`/`rawOutput` are
kept, the persisted `title` is pinned to the canonical tool name, and
`schedulingTimeZone` is recorded — this machine's IANA zone, captured at persist time,
because cron is local-time to it and the panel must resolve fire times in that zone via
`nextCronFireMs` rather than the viewer's browser zone. Also retain `recordedAtMs`,
the first-persisted wall-clock sighting: cron-fire steers extend the turn's `endedAt`
past a one-shot fire minute, so using it as the creation anchor can roll the fire to
next year. For one-shot crons, prefer the output's `nextFireAt` over any anchor.

This is what lets the web derive its "session will continue" panel from the
Cron/ScheduleWakeup `tool_call` items in history: the CLI persists NO extra
scheduled-task state, neither in `SessionMeta` nor as a new history item. See
`@lody/shared` `collectPendingScheduledTasksFromHistory` and `nextCronFireMs`. The
deriver reads exactly those fields — do not "clean up" this exception, or the panel
goes silently empty (unit tests fabricate history and will not catch it).

The former `_meta.claudeCode.toolName` carrier is read only by the centralized
one-release compatibility path; new provider output must use the Core contract.

## Flush, evidence, and shutdown

Permission requests must drain earlier buffered/in-flight ACP updates before
materializing a missing tool row. If the bounded drain leaves queued writes,
cancel the request rather than inserting a tool into an unfinished text stream.

Turn finalization cancels unanswered permission/question requests in the owning
assistant entry through the existing history write. Preserve answered outcomes
and other turns; the history subscription releases the waiter and the renderer
withdraws the card. Do not add a parallel cancellation registry or Pi-only path.
Permission writes targeting a finished entry are refused, never attached to a
newer turn; the existing failed-persistence path returns cancellation to ACP.

Parse tool content before enrichment inspects known fields. Unknown protocol blocks
remain JSON, while malformed known blocks are rejected. Deterministic HistoryWriteError
notifications are isolated and reported, never requeued as transient failures; the
consumed-prefix watermark includes these explicit rejections so healthy output continues.

Targeted text/thought-only batches use the SessionDocument `onlyEntryId` path into
HistoryWriter. Tool/subagent updates retain full-history ownership routing because
their original item may be in an older turn; a mixed batch must not be narrowed.

These bind `../message-handler.ts` and `../session-transient-store.ts`, which drive
this pipeline. Flush retries retain notification-level progress and cached
rich-content materialization — never re-upload an attachment after only its history
write failed — stop after a bounded backoff budget, and carry the enqueue-time turn id
into Code Collab evidence. Evidence arriving for a finalized target is serialized
through the same per-turn persistence chain as normal finalization; a failed attempt
restores both captured evidence sets ahead of concurrently collected evidence and
schedules bounded, evidence-only backoff retries that never replay the
already-persisted ACP history update.

Shutdown order: cancel those timers, stop SessionManager producers while keeping
workspace documents open, wait for already-started async evidence collectors, flush
ACP/evidence, then close stores. Never close a store or take the final map/chain
snapshot while agent callbacks or tracked evidence collectors can still populate turn
evidence. Permanent deletion blocks new ACP enqueue, waits for an already-started
flush, and drops retry state before deleting the session doc, so a late retry cannot
recreate deleted data.

The finalized-turn late-ACP routing target in `../session-transient-store.ts` does NOT
expire by wall-clock time: agent sessions stay alive and emit events long after
`stopReason` (cron, `ScheduleWakeup`, deferred work), and those must still reach the
Loro doc. Clear it only when a new turn owns ACP updates (normally `beginTurn()`, but
visible dispatch defers until prompt start) or on replay suppression.

Turn-scoped history LIST writes in `../message-handler.ts` (assistant entry creation,
ACP/proposed-plan flushes, finalization, chat_failed notices, image-group entries) must
first `await awaitTurnHistoryGate(sessionId)` — see
`../../session/turn-history-gate.ts`. Add the same await to any NEW code path that
appends or positions history entries during a turn; map-keyed status/meta writes stay
ungated.
