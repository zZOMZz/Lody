 * - Stamp ONLY on a fresh approval → dead in the approve-then-open-PR order,
 *   which is the primary flow. The approval happens before a PR exists, so there
 *   is no head to record; by the time one exists the state has left `reviewing`
 *   and never returns, so the check never arms at all.
 *
 * `isFreshApproval` re-stamps after each genuine re-approval (kills the loop);
 * the `!approvedSha` fallback records the first head known after an approval
 * that predated the PR (arms the check in that order). Once set, the fallback is
 * inert, so it cannot resurrect the loop.
