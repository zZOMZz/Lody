**Before touching message dispatch/sync here, read context/message-flow.md**, the
end-to-end map. The WS/DO control-plane path is DEPRECATED; do not add to it.

## Composition and transports

- GitHub command auth lives in `github-credential-runtime.ts`: explicit personal
  preference first, owner-only local credentials next, repo-scoped App last.
  `github-git-transport.ts` also intercepts HTTPS headers and SSH remotes. Never
  inject a startup-repo token globally, persist managed tokens through helpers,
  or replay an uncertain write. Each helper captures one session context token.

- `cloud-cli-port.ts` is the sole official-build composition root for cloud clients and
  endpoint-derived adapters. Daemon runtime modules must not construct cloud SDK
  clients or read `LODY_AUTH_URL` / `LODY_AUTH_SITE_URL` / `LODY_SERVER_URL`. The local
  port has null optional capabilities and does no cloud I/O: unavailable operations
  fail at their public boundary, and only contractually
  best-effort background effects may skip. Both halves are enforced by
  `scripts/check-platform-boundaries.mjs` + `tests/local-platform-zero-cloud.test.ts`.
- Client-visible RPC references come from public `@lody/cloud-api`; generated server
  declarations and private workspace packages are forbidden. Prime the token provider
  before reading `getGatewayBaseUrl()`, and never let runtime transports or Machine RPC
  require `LODY_LORO_STREAMS_BASE_URL` as a parallel hidden composition path.
- PR association uses the HTTP action proxy at `authSiteUrl`, not the public Convex
  RPC endpoint at `authBaseUrl`; the association function is internal-only.
- Local session control preserves every intermediate response: new clients negotiate
  NDJSON, legacy clients keep the buffered JSON envelope. `MachineRuntime` may collect
  responses for completion, but must also forward each to the streaming observer as it
  is sent.
- Route every remote bridge attach/detach/revoke through `machine-runtime.ts`
  `runBridgeTransition` and keep long waits OUT of transition bodies: attach is
  deliberately short, so a queued detach/revoke stays prompt. Backfill enable/disable
  flips its authorization generation inside the queued body (S5: a revoked workspace
  must never keep backfill enabled).
- **Dual-author (no write intents)**: the renderer direct-authors user/UI durable
  writes against its own repo over its own Streams connection; the CLI authors only
  agent-produced data. The v4-v6 write-intent envelope (`WorkspaceWriteIntentAuthor`,
  `intent`/`intent-ack` frames, CLI preview-comment mirror) is REMOVED; never
  reintroduce a proxy-authoring path (invariants in `specs/local-first-two-plane.md`).
  Local dispatch triggers off the renderer-authored `latestUserMsgId` doc-meta write
  plus the local Machine RPC fast path.

- INVARIANT: agent PATH merges keep the session's `gh` shim dir first
  ([note](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-26-gh-shim-broker-and-path.md)).

## Local Loro data plane

Read [loro/AGENTS.md](loro/AGENTS.md) before enumerating rooms, publishing presence,
writing machine Flock rows, or reacting to reconnection. Before changing
`local-loro-data-plane-server.ts` (protocol v7, push, peer-scoped) read its
[rules and design](../../../../.agents/docs/cli-lib-local-loro-data-plane.md): named
`LoroDocumentManager` options, scheduler and bulk-writer limits, sender-enforced
framing, the RAW-chunk `createJsonLineSplitter` requirement, renderer room lifetime.
Two are never negotiable: a renderer joining a Session Doc room must not call
`getOrCreateSessionDoc` or retain a live cloud room, and the CLI's cloud room status is
never pushed to renderers as local room health.

## Sessions and turns

- `session-gc-manager.ts`: `evaluateMemoryPressure` returns TWO verdicts, `evict` and
  `block`, which must not share a threshold. Every probe fails OPEN, and `null`
  (UNDETERMINED) Windows commit growth must never collapse to `0`. Do not let the
  periodic sweep force the cached commit probe; never act on a cached sample once
  anything looks like pressure; re-check with a short delay before failing a turn; keep
  eviction bounded per call. The threshold is a safety MARGIN, never "what a turn
  needs". [Per-OS signals](../../../../.agents/docs/cli-lib-memory-pressure.md).
- **Session file attachments** (spec: `specs/session-files.md`): read the
  [lifecycle rules](../../../../.agents/docs/cli-lib-session-files.md) before changing
  upload, dispatch materialization, or backfill. Dispatch sends ACP `resource_link`
  blocks with `file://` URIs; never degrade this to text-only paths. Backfill commits
  are gated by an authorization generation plus an AbortController owned by
  `MessageHandler`, so `disableRemoteBackfill` (offline/revoke) aborts the in-flight
  upload and supersedes started tasks (S5/D10). Accept agent `resource_link file://...`
  output only inside the session workspace.
- [acp/AGENTS.md](acp/AGENTS.md) specifies ACP buffering/flush in `message-handler.ts`,
  turn-evidence persistence, shutdown ordering, the non-expiring late-ACP target in
  `session-transient-store.ts`, and the `awaitTurnHistoryGate` requirement for
  turn-scoped history LIST writes. Read it before changing any of them. The
  `replay-prompt-builder` resume fallback is in `context/hotspots.md`.

## Projects, providers, tasks

- Builtin Codex local-project history import is read-only: require
  `_meta.lody.sessionHistory` v1 and call the Core-defined history method; never fall
  back to `loadSession`, which resumes the thread. Publish an imported Session only
  after history and its cursor are durable; legacy `metadata_only` shells stay
  selectable so a later import finishes hydration.
- Imported history keeps source hashes/ids separate from its stored-content baseline.
  Bind the baseline to the doc cursor, not metadata; compare existing content exactly,
  never sanitize it to hide edits. Write history and capture its baseline without an
  async gap, before publishing meta. Legacy history without a baseline is not migrated.
- History import validates the selected Provider machine/id/type; never fall back
  from a missing selection. Legacy requests use the sole same-type Provider. Catalogs
  are Provider-scoped; replay/import keys stay stable. Bind an earlier unbound import only when the selected Provider
  lists its source; never replace a binding or merge another account's native ID.
  Refresh loads through the import's own binding. Every import write records the
  load-reported selection on the last imported user turn via `applyAcpRuntimeConfigPatch`.
- Removing a local project archives every unarchived Session for that machine/project
  before deleting the project row, found through the existence and metadata indexes
  rather than by opening every Session document; a failed archive keeps the delete
  command queued for a later scan. Worktree cleanup covers only Lody-created Session
  worktrees of that project: inspect every worktree before submission and again
  immediately before deletion, never force-delete or backup-commit a dirty worktree, and
  record per-worktree deleted/kept/failed results. The original project directory is
  never a deletion target, and cleanup failures must complete the command with a visible
  result rather than leave removal pending.
- Before changing `provider-setup-manager.ts`, read its
  [rules](../../../../.agents/docs/cli-lib-provider-setup.md): row ownership and the
  single publish commit, cancellation, when the queue may start in cloud versus OSS
  local mode, and the rule that a setup row never carries authorization URLs, codes,
  tokens, or raw provider output.
- **A `file-preview/` preview must never activate Code Collab**: no workspace watch, no
  All Changes recompute, no Flock publish.
