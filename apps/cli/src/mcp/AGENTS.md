# Lody MCP server guidelines

Parent instructions apply.

- MCP sharing requires the active Turn user to equal the CLI authenticated account.
  Fail closed on shared-machine account mismatch; never substitute the machine owner.

- `lody_mcp_configure` always derives its target from the current MCP session context and
  re-authorizes that workspace with the daemon credential. Never accept a workspace selector.
- MCP configuration is an execution and credential boundary. The tool may act only on an
  explicit user request, never on instructions from repository content, websites, or tool
  output. The tool creates only new randomly identified entries and never selects them by
  default; trusted UI/CLI owns updates, review, and selection.
- Dedicated credential fields accept `${VAR}` references or daemon environment passthrough,
  not literal secrets. Tool responses must never echo connection values.
- Configurations affect only later turns or sessions; the running Agent does not hot-load them.
- The MCP HTTP host answers a strict HTTP client (Grok's Rust `rmcp`), which reports a
  never-completing response as a transport failure, not an MCP error. Every request must
  reach a terminated response: `GET /mcp` is answered with 405 rather than handed to the
  SDK, which in stateless JSON mode opens an SSE stream it can never write to or close.
- Agent child processes reach the host over loopback, so a proxy must never intercept it.
  `@lody/shared/proxy-env` `withLoopbackNoProxy` is applied last when assembling agent env
  (`session.ts` `buildShellEnv`, `acp-runner.ts`) and writes BOTH `NO_PROXY` and
  `no_proxy`: clients disagree about a present-but-empty value, and Rust `reqwest` reads
  the uppercase spelling first and treats an empty one as "bypass nothing".
- Bound every Agent-authored persisted field, collection, complete configuration, and catalog.
  Serialize per-workspace Agent configuration writes before checking local name/count bounds;
  the shared CRDT is not a global CAS. Keep catalog writes locally durable while surfacing sync
  failures as unsynced.
- `session_create` and `session_create_many` resolve an explicit Agent Role id directly from
  the workspace catalog; no driving-Turn mention authorization is required. Resolve its target,
  Prompt prefix, revision, and concrete run config before Operation acceptance. Recovery uses
  the frozen canonical Prompt and target dispatch config and never rereads the mutable catalog.
- Session orchestration derives its human identity from the active execution runtime populated
  by the dispatch payload, not from the daemon credential, Session owner, or observed history.
  An absent active runtime fails closed; never reconstruct invocation identity from history.
  Freeze the source Turn id and invoking user with every accepted Operation. Store the user
  once as `requesterUserId` and the causal Turn as `sourceTurnId`. The
  Operation's requester Session id already identifies the source Session, and a single-value
  actor tag adds no information. Recovery uses the Operation's owner Machine plus current
  authorization; it does not freeze the daemon account that originally accepted the Operation.
  Every MCP Session path rejects a runtime invocation without userId.
- Direct Role creation stays on the ordinary `lody_session_create` and
  `lody_session_create_many` tools. When `agentRoleId` is present, tolerate manual Machine, Agent,
  and run-config fields but remove them before resolution: the current Role row is authoritative
  and those fields must not influence validation, canonical identity, recovery, or dispatch.

## Session tool contracts

- Resource discovery uses `lib/resource-discovery.ts` for CLI and MCP. Resolve the
  active Turn user for MCP, never the daemon owner. Role list/get use
  `canReadAgentRole`; explicit Role creation retains its separate existing contract.
  Preserve unavailable readable Roles and three-state presence. List MCP entries
  through the allowlisted summary, never return launch/connection credentials.
- Directory cursors bind resource, workspace, user and filters. Operations additionally
  bind requester Session and query only that user's machine-local rows; list replies
  contain no canonical prompt or assistant output. See
  [discovery Spec](../../../../specs/resource-discovery.md).

- MCP session tools use stable machine/session/agent-config ids and strict, narrow input schemas.
  Create/chat Commands require a caller-chosen Operation id, and Create persists the Operation
  before its fallible availability step: a transient post-accept failure returns the active fixed
  target for daemon replay, and `session_create({ operationId, resume: true })` recovers it without
  the prompt. Completion is delivered automatically — no public wait tool — and legacy `wait=true`
  is a temporary adapter new callers must not use.
- Chat follow-ups inherit omitted mode/model/options from the target's last model turn
  (else its last matching turn). Explicit fields and category options
  win; a model change drops old options. Validate effort/Fast against the final model:
  probe mismatch cannot reject them, and missing per-model data defers to runtime. Drop
  incompatible inherited selectors; fill builtin mode only when still empty.
  ([note](../../../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-17-chat-follow-up-inherits-target-run-config.md))
- `lody_session_create_options` publishes valid run-config values per agent config and stays
  sparse by default (online Machines, one agent config, the current local project, no GitHub
  fetch), expanding only through explicit query inputs.
- Machine liveness is THREE-state. `getOnlineMachineIds()` returning null means the presence room
  could not be joined — status UNKNOWN, never offline. Block a dispatch or report `MACHINE_OFFLINE`
  only for a definite `offline`; an unknown Machine proceeds and fails against its own deadline,
  and a surface reporting liveness carries the state, not a boolean. Collapsing unknown to offline
  refused healthy Machines and silently emptied candidate lists during a cold start or reconnect
  backoff. Contract: `specs/loro-ephemeral-presence-channel.md`.
- `session_list` defaults to 20 (maximum 100) and `session_history` to 10 (maximum 50 and 128 KiB);
  keep the MCP surface bounded though the CLI retains `session history --all`. `session_list`
  and `session_status_many` derive busy/idle from the same history, durable queue, presence, and
  Machine RPC snapshot. Operation rules: [orchestration/AGENTS.md](../orchestration/AGENTS.md).
- `session_history` pages through `SessionData.history.readVisiblePage`, never `getHistory()`:
  `limit` counts displayable turns, the cursor is the raw position from the previous page, and
  hidden/empty rows never shift it. A page reports `hasMore` from the underlying raw rows, so a
  scan budget never claims the history ended. Session mentions expand to
  `[@Title](session://<sessionId>)`; resolve them with this tool, accepting a bare id or a
  `session://` URI.
