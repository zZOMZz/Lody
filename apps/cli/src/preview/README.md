# Managed cloudflared lifecycle and distribution

## Process ownership

```text
CLI / QuickTunnelSession
  └─ cloudflared-worker.js (private IPC ownership)
       └─ pinned native cloudflared + temporary config
```

`cloudflared-process.ts` launches the lightweight owner and interprets its typed
origin/diagnostic/error messages. `cloudflared-worker.ts` releases resources on
an IPC stop request, parent disconnect or termination signal; `cloudflared-native.ts`
owns native startup/log parsing and bounded TERM → KILL escalation. There is no
polling, process discovery, persistent PID state, automatic restart or dev-server
ownership. Session readiness, idle timeout and endpoint credentials stay in the CLI.
The trade-off is one additional Node process per live tunnel, rather than a shared
watchdog with a registry and cross-session failure policy.

Normal shutdown keeps IPC open until error reporting is complete. Completion means
the lifecycle owner's OS exit after native exit and config removal, not merely
that shutdown was requested. A disconnected parent cannot receive cleanup errors.
The owner itself being forcibly killed is outside this parent-disconnect guarantee.

Public, Cloud and development bundles emit the same sibling worker entry. Source
integration fixtures explicitly build that entry in their scratch directory;
production never falls back to TypeScript execution. POSIX process tests cover
normal stop, CLI SIGKILL during creation/active use, native crash, missing binaries
and cleanup failure. Native verification on other operating systems is separate.

Native dependencies can emit plain-text diagnostics even with `--output json`.
The log reader ignores bounded non-JSON lines; structured messages still require
schema validation, and allocated origins still require the Quick Tunnel allowlist.
Fatal parser and size-limit errors survive shutdown so a later DNS cancellation
cannot replace the original failure.

## First public request

`preview-tunnel-dns.ts` queries the configured DNS servers with a private Node
Resolver, bypassing OS hostname lookup caches. A newly allocated Quick Tunnel
hostname can initially return NXDOMAIN. Sending it to an HTTP proxy or TUN at
that point can cache failure long after the tunnel is usable. The startup
verifier waits for the bounded DNS publication check and the native connector's
first registration, reported through typed IPC, before its first public request. All stages
share the existing 90-second readiness deadline and cancellation signal.

Negative DNS answers retry for at most ten seconds before falling back to the
existing proxy HTTP verification: filtered/split local DNS may stay negative even
when the proxy can resolve the hostname. Unavailable DNS transport falls back
immediately. The DNS budget cancels in-flight queries without resetting the
shared startup deadline; parent cancellation still aborts readiness. No IP
is pinned, no external resolver is selected, and DNS never grants access or proves
readiness. Five-second active health checks and local viewing skip this startup gate.

Startup also retries network/host-unreachable errors within the same deadline.
Dual-stack connection errors are inspected across bounded aggregate branches;
permanent errors such as certificate failures still fail immediately. Diagnostics
retain validated IP addresses and address families, never arbitrary error messages.
The shared CLI HTTP dispatcher explicitly enables Node address-family selection
for direct destinations and proxy connections. Proxy routing remains authoritative;
an unavailable proxy does not authorize a direct connection. This also benefits
other callers of that dispatcher; explicit Node-default transport mode is unchanged.

## Distribution

`cloudflared-manifest.json` pins upstream release artifacts. The downloader uses
the public runtime channel, checks their bytes, and atomically installs an
executable with `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`. The notices come from a static JSON
import in `cloudflared-binary.ts`, so source, bundled CLI and embedded CLI use the
same text without a second asset-copy pipeline. Existing incomplete installations
are errors, not repair or migration inputs.

## Updating notices with the pinned release

The generated JSON contains exact collected license/notice text, the release URL,
all release Go versions, and source `go.mod`/`go.sum` hashes. Do not edit individual generated
license texts. Changing the manifest version also requires regenerating notices;
the binary helper rejects mismatched release metadata.

1. Check out the matching upstream source and inspect the downloaded binaries
   using `go version -m -json <binary>`. Match their Go version and compiled module
   paths, versions, checksums and replacements against the source dependency graph.
2. Use `github.com/google/go-licenses/v2@v2.0.1` with the pinned module graph. From the
   upstream source directory, collect `go-licenses save ./cmd/cloudflared
--save_path=<output-dir>` for each row below, setting `GOOS`, `GOARCH` and
   `CGO_ENABLED`. Save each output in a separate directory. Do not reuse an output
   from another release.
3. Review tool warnings and non-Go sources separately. The collector cannot prove
   that assembly/C or dynamically linked libraries have no additional obligations.
4. Obtain the source for every Go version reported by the artifacts, verifying
   official archive checksums. Include each root's runtime and vendor notices;
   do not infer the release's toolchain from the current machine's binary alone.
   From the public repository, run:

   ```sh
   node scripts/generate-cloudflared-notices.mjs <upstream-source-dir> <go-source-dir>... -- <darwin-arm64-notices> <darwin-amd64-notices> <linux-amd64-notices> <linux-arm64-notices> <windows-amd64-notices>
   node --test scripts/generate-cloudflared-notices.test.mjs
   ```

5. Inspect the generated diff, run the binary install tests and rebuild the CLI.
   Notice conflicts across platforms or same-version Go roots fail generation
   rather than choosing one. The installed notice heading lists release toolchains,
   not a single toolchain claimed for every platform.

| GOOS    | GOARCH | CGO_ENABLED | Artifact Go version | Module dependencies |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| darwin  | arm64  | 1           | 1.26.2              | 66                  |
| darwin  | amd64  | 1           | 1.26.2              | 66                  |
| linux   | amd64  | 0           | 1.26.8              | 67                  |
| linux   | arm64  | 0           | 1.26.8              | 67                  |
| windows | amd64  | 1           | 1.26.8              | 66                  |

Windows ARM64 uses the same pinned Windows AMD64 artifact; it does not introduce
another dependency graph. Native execution on supported platforms is a separate
acceptance requirement.

## Current evidence and limits

The 2026.9.1 collection merges 100 notice files from the five platform selections
and both Go source roots. A cross-platform metadata audit corrected the original
single-Go-version assumption and Windows CGO setting; Windows notices were
recollected with CGO enabled. Module collection used Go 1.26.2; exact runtime/vendor
texts also come from checksum-verified Go 1.26.8 source.

All five distinct artifact checksums, module versions/checksums/replacements and
at least one collected notice's exact source bytes per compiled module were
verified against the tag's 159-module graph. `go-licenses` labels some inherited
root licenses by package import path; replacements retain the original import
path label but must match the replacement source's license text.

All five report dirty main-module revision `f11dea9cb7079e90a982c1a2d5548ab40847fdcf`,
different from the source tag: dependency agreement does not prove an identical
source build. Non-Go warnings and native linkage still need review before
publication. The generated text is not a claim that every distribution obligation
has been independently verified.

Behavioral tests check deterministic collection, platform conflicts, source
license mismatch, installed text, cache reuse and explicit rejection of missing
or modified cached notices.

## Agent-reported startup

The local message handler derives the active execution user and passes it separately
from the candidate payload. An available loopback candidate from the Session owner
starts background preparation when the platform supports remote preview. Reports
return promptly; Browser clicks join preparation and then retain the usual control
authorization checks. Same-origin reports coalesce; newer origins, revoke and
Session cleanup cancel obsolete queued work. Resource limits and the one-hour idle
policy still apply, including to a prepared preview that nobody opens.
