`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

Managed preview tunnels and the local proxy. [apps/cli/AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) applies.

- Quick Tunnel replacement is in progress; target contract:
  [Quick Tunnel preview](../../../../specs/quick-tunnel-preview.md).
  `preview-http.ts` owns shared target/path guards, header conversion and optional
  HTML injection; these helpers must not depend on a transport implementation.
- `cloudflared-manifest.json` is the only version/checksum source. The binary helper
  uses the public runtime channel and verifies cached executables; never discover
  PATH binaries. Bundle the matching generated license/notice texts and install
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` alongside the executable atomically; incomplete caches
  fail explicitly. See [notice maintenance](README.md).
  Audit every distinct artifact's Go version and CGO setting. A release can use
  multiple toolchains; include each runtime/vendor notice set, not only the host's.
  `cloudflared-process.ts` owns the IPC lifecycle child; `cloudflared-worker.ts`
  runs `cloudflared-native.ts`, which owns the isolated config and native child.
  Normal shutdown uses IPC so cleanup errors can return; IPC disconnect also
  triggers cleanup after CLI death. No polling, restart policy or PID registry.
  Never kill the lifecycle child as a normal shutdown shortcut. Wait for its OS
  exit; it first reaps cloudflared and removes its config. Keep the Node child's
  `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, but never pass Lody credentials or supervisor tokens.
  All CLI builds emit a sibling `cloudflared-worker.js`; no source-loader fallback.
  Native logs use the pinned release's `--output json`.
  Ignore bounded non-JSON dependency diagnostics; validate structured lifecycle
  logs and origins, and preserve fatal parser errors through native shutdown.
  Allocating an origin is not readiness. Before a Quick Tunnel's first public
  HTTP probe, await edge registration and query DNS records through an isolated
  Resolver, not OS hostname lookup: early NXDOMAIN can poison proxy/TUN caches.
  Registration, DNS and HTTP share the startup deadline. DNS publication has a
  10-second budget: persistent negative answers (including filtered/split DNS)
  then fall back to the existing HTTP proxy path, as do transport failures. Never
  hardcode public IPs or treat DNS/registration as readiness. Health/local viewing skip this gate.
  Public probes do not renew idle time.
  Startup retries network-unreachable errors within that deadline; inspect all
  aggregate error branches so permanent TLS failures still fail immediately.
  Readiness diagnostics retain attempt counts, pending state, last HTTP status or
  nested network error codes, and connector registration progress. Never log
  capability-bearing request URLs, arbitrary fetch error messages or response bodies.
  Status reads check active public routes within five seconds; concurrent reads
  share a probe. Unlike startup readiness, health failures are not retried: fail
  and clean up this endpoint, never a replacement created while the probe awaited.
- `PreviewService` now creates only `QuickTunnelSession` remote owners. The owner
  releases its proxy and child on cancellation, failed readiness, idle expiry or
  process exit. Its `closed` result is a cleanup barrier, not just a signal sent.
  Lifecycle writes are serialized per Session; revoke cancels acquisition before
  joining that queue. One-hour activity deadlines stay in memory. Machine slots
  span workspaces in the singleton Worker, never a PID registry on disk.
- Remote create/revoke/status must pass `authorizeRemoteControl` before touching
  endpoint state. Workspace RPC does not authenticate a claimed user id. Its
  short-lived signed proof binds the exact command and runtime nonce; the authority
  consumes each request id once, including concurrent duplicates. Verify project
  access from CLI-resolved metadata, never a caller-supplied project. Local controls
  use the trusted local route without cloud authorization; no remote fallback.
- Endpoint capabilities are checked on every HTTP request and WS upgrade. There
  is no global unlock: a matching Origin/tokenless Referer never grants access.
  Local and remote listeners use different random tokens; remote token cookies
  are Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=None and Partitioned. A remote viewer origin must
  be explicitly bound, never inferred from Host or forwarded headers.
- A WS upgrade is acknowledged only after the upstream selects its subprotocol.
  Preserve text/binary frames and close shape; use socket backpressure, not an
  unbounded pre-handshake frame queue. Closing an endpoint invalidates it before
  aborting all owned HTTP requests, upstream WS and accepted sockets.

- Node fetch overwrites navigation `Sec-Fetch-Mode` with `cors`. The shared HTTP
  header builder removes browser Fetch Metadata only for navigation requests;
  preserve subresource metadata and foreign/opaque/missing Origin so cross-site
  resource/CSRF checks still apply. Only the exact explicitly bound viewer Origin
  maps to the approved local Origin, for HTTP and WS alike; never derive this
  mapping from Host or forwarded headers. Test through real HTTP/WS boundaries.

- Annotation is optional: probe proxy reachability independently of runtime injection.
  Preserve valid page bytes when injection alone would exceed the response limit.
- A streaming response failure must cancel its upstream body before releasing the
  reader lock. Lock release alone leaves unfinished origin responses alive.

- Preview targets are untrusted, and a managed preview reaches THIS machine's loopback and
  nothing else — agent candidate or user-approved alike, there is no policy under which a LAN
  host is accepted (`normalizeTarget` in `preview-service.ts`). The tunnel makes this machine the
  origin of whatever it connects to, so a LAN target would turn it into a pivot into its own
  network for a remote workspace member or an agent that talked them into a click; the approver
  cannot see what a LAN address here even is. Clients never send one, but this check must hold for
  any client.
- Loopback means a literal address or the exact name `localhost`. `classifyBrowserHostname` reads
  the hostname text, so any `*.localhost` name passes it while a search domain or rebinding record
  can point that name at a LAN host.
- `preview-target-transport.ts` binds probes and forwarding to the same literal loopback
  address, retaining the approved Host/TLS identity. HTTP uses an endpoint-owned Undici Pool
  and WS the same fixed lookup; ambient DNS and global HTTP proxies cannot retarget it.
  Closing an endpoint also destroys its dispatcher. IPv4/IPv6-only localhost services
  must both work without changing the user's listener configuration.
- User-triggered remote controls still require fresh target approval. A valid local
  Agent report may start preparation using ONLY the active execution's user identity,
  which must match the Session initiator; never infer it from session/daemon ownership.
  Keep this trusted entry separate from remote report payloads. Coalesce same-origin
  preparation and cancel queued work on replacement, revoke and Session cleanup.
  `reportedStarts` owns eager cancellation; `cancelled` is only for manual creation.
  Keep generation guards inside serialized preview-state writes and invalidate
  reports still validating during full cleanup.
  Validate path-relative targets here.
- The local preview proxy must never forward an OBSERVED WebSocket close code into a Close frame.
  RFC 6455 reserves 1005/1006 for local observation, so `ws` throws from a TCP callback and kills
  the CLI with the active Agent session. Mirror the shape instead (`mirrorWebSocketClose` in
  `local-preview-proxy.ts`): `terminate()` for 1006, code-less `close()` for 1005. Both
  directions, plus the local-socket `error` handler, which must not pre-empt that mirror once the
  connection is open.
