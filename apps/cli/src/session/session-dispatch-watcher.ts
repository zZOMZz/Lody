/**
 * ## Session Dispatch Watcher — Behavioral Design
 *
 * This class watches CRDT session documents and dispatches user messages to the
 * execution service. It is the bridge between "a user typed something on the web"
 * and "the CLI agent starts working."
 *
 * ### Event Sources (inputs)
 *
 * Three event sources trigger dispatch checks:
 *
 * 1. **Metadata watch** (`repo.watch('doc-metadata')`) — fires when any session's
 *    CRDT metadata changes (e.g. new session created, status updated, cancel requested).
 *    This is the primary trigger for new sessions and cancel requests.
 *
 * 2. **Session subscription** (`sessionDoc.subscribeAll()`) — fires when a session
 *    doc's content changes (e.g. new user message synced from the web client).
 *    This handles follow-up messages on already-watched sessions.
 *
 * 3. **RPC turn push** (`offerRpcTurn`, wired from the `session/dispatch-turn`
 *    Machine RPC) — the web client pushes the full turn payload ahead of history
 *    CRDT sync. The payload is stashed as a third turn source (history → queue →
 *    stash) and a dispatch check is enqueued; the RPC response is a delivery ACK
 *    only. The session doc stays the durable source of truth — an RPC loss just
 *    falls back to sources 1/2. Turns executed from the stash before their
 *    history entry syncs are reconciled by `maybeRepairAlreadyHandledTurn` so the
 *    late-arriving `pending` entry is repaired instead of dispatched twice.
 *
 * ### Dispatch Decision Tree
 *
 * When a check is triggered for a session, `maybeHandleSession` evaluates this
 * decision tree (all inputs are read fresh each time):
 *
 * ```
 * 1. Guard: not owned by this machine, or archived?
 *    └─ yes → noop (not our responsibility)
 *
 * 2. Guard: active turn is still creating/restoring its ACP session?
 *    └─ yes → noop (wait for it to finish)
 *
 * 3. Status is running / initializing / requestPermission?
 *    ├─ AND has active turn owner → noop (actively working, don't interrupt)
 *    └─ AND no active turn owner  → RESET status to idle
 *       (Stale status from a previous CRA crash. Without reset, the session
 *        would be permanently stuck. After reset, fall through to step 4.)
 *
 * 4. Find a dispatchable user turn in history:
 *    - A turn is "dispatchable" if:
 *      • status is 'pending', 'seen', or 'processing' (new status field), OR
 *      • read === false (legacy field), OR
 *      • id matches meta.processingUserMsgId (interrupted processing), OR
 *      • id matches meta.latestUserMsgId but NOT meta.lastHandledUserMsgId
 *    - If no turn found in history, try promoting from the message queue (I/O)
 *      via `SessionDocument.appendUserTurn`, which publishes the pointer too.
 *    - If still nothing AND the pointer's entry is genuinely absent, wait for
 *      remote sync and retry (the race where metadata arrives before session doc
 *      content syncs from the web client). A pointer whose entry is already
 *      terminal is settled instead — history has answered, so waiting cannot.
 *    └─ pending meta still has no history turn after 5m → negatively acknowledge
 *       that exact turn id and unload the session doc
 *
 * 5. Dispatch the turn:
 *    ├─ No reusable session AND no acpSessionId → startSession (create)
 *    └─ Otherwise                              → continueSession (chat)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Cancel Decision Tree
 *
 * Cancel checks run on a separate chain from dispatch checks (so a cancel can
 * proceed even while a dispatch is in-flight):
 *
 * ```
 * 1. Guard: not owned / archived / no lastCanceledTurn → noop
 * 2. Guard: lastCanceledTurn === already-seen turn     → noop (deduplicate)
 * 3. Execute cancel, record the turn as seen.
 * ```
 *
 * ### Concurrency Model
 *
 * Each session has two independent serialized promise chains:
 * - `sessionCheckChains` — at most one `maybeHandleSession` runs per session at a time.
 *   If multiple events fire while a check is in progress, exactly one follow-up check
 *   runs after it completes (coalescing): `enqueueSessionCheck` reuses the queued,
 *   not-yet-started check instead of appending another one. This matters because
 *   the dispatch branch awaits the whole agent turn, and the session mirror fires
 *   once per commit while the agent streams output — a long turn would otherwise
 *   leave hundreds of backlogged checks, each re-reading the full history
 *   (~130 ms on a 13 MB doc), and drain them back-to-back on microtasks without
 *   ever yielding to timers (observed: 42 s of event-loop starvation). A check that
 *   follows another one in the chain also yields one macrotask first, so even a
 *   real drain cannot starve timers or the Loro heartbeat.
 * - `cancelCheckChains` — same pattern for cancel requests. Separate from dispatch
 *   so that a cancel can be processed without waiting for a long-running dispatch.
 *
 * ### Turn-Finding Retry Strategy
 *
 * `findOrAwaitDispatchableTurn` only waits when metadata explicitly names work:
 *
 * ```
 * Phase 1 (local): check history → try queue promotion → RPC stash
 * Phase 2 (pending meta): keep the history room joined and wait up to 5m
 * Otherwise: return idle; metadata/RPC events reactivate the session later
 * ```
 *
 * ### User-Visible Dispatch Recovery Contract
 *
 * A web send is committed through two CRDT surfaces: session metadata and session
 * history. Metadata can sync first (`latestUserMsgId` / `processingUserMsgId`
 * says there is work), while the History CRDT entry for that user turn is still
 * missing locally. The CLI must not start a prompt until it can read the actual
 * history turn because the turn carries the prompt blocks, user id, config, and
 * queue semantics. This creates a visible gap where the message can look "seen"
 * by the machine, but the machine is not yet allowed to enter Working.
 *
 * The user expectation for that gap is:
 * - if the machine is online and has access, the session should enter Working
 *   as soon as the matching history turn arrives;
 * - if the history turn never arrives, the UI should receive one clear delivery
 *   failure within a bounded time instead of waiting forever;
 * - a failed recovery must not permanently poison the session: sending a fresh
 *   message should write a fresh pending pointer and wake the CLI again.
 *
 * To satisfy that contract, explicit pending metadata gets one five-minute
 * history-sync window. During that window we keep the SessionDoc joined and
 * listen for both mirror updates and transport room status. On a room disconnect
 * or error, we make one jittered `rejoinDocRoom()` attempt. The wait is passive:
 * we do not mutate `session.status` while waiting because non-idle status writes
 * can still be mistaken for durable activity by legacy readers; live UI should
 * rely on ephemeral presence for the "Working" indicator. We also
 * do not repeatedly unload and recreate the document: that makes the observed
 * state harder to reason about, churns subscriptions, and was the source of
 * confusing "message could not be delivered" failures when metadata won the
 * sync race.
 *
 * If the five-minute window expires, we mark dispatch recovery unhealthy,
 * preserve the producer/executor pointers and `lastHandledUserMsgId`, record the
 * exact id in `lastMissingHistoryUserMsgId`, and unload the session doc. Watch
 * activation and turn selection ignore a pointer only while it equals that
 * negative acknowledgement. A future send publishes a different id (and clears
 * the marker), which naturally wakes dispatch again. Preserving the pointers is
 * essential: clearing either one after an awaited refresh can overwrite a newer
 * activation or processing claim from another peer.
 * The tradeoff is that a genuinely late History CRDT update after the timeout
 * is never dispatched: the marker is permanent for that exact turn, and the
 * renderer derives a visible "not delivered" label for it from the marker plus
 * its non-terminal status (no CLI repair write, no schema change). Recovery is
 * a fresh send — the row's "not delivered" label opens a confirmation dialog
 * that re-sends the same content as a brand-new message (new turn id). The
 * renderer retains the marker and supersedes the abandoned entry to
 * `canceled`.
 *
 * Sessions without an explicit activation signal stay metadata-only. History is
 * a turn-selection source after activation, not a startup activation index.

   * serialized per session, and we only reach here with no active turn, so
   * clearing a slot whose turn is verifiably terminal is safe and repairs a
   * crashed-mid-turn leftover.

   * short-circuits into missing-history recovery and accuses that survivor of
