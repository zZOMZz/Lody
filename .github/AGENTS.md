# GitHub contribution automation

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Ownership

| Area | Source of truth | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contributor prompts | `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, Issue Forms | Ask only for public, actionable contribution context. |
| PR validation | `scripts/check-pr-body.mjs` | Validate the rendered template contract without GitHub mutations. |
| PR reconciliation | `scripts/pr-policy.mjs` | Own disposition, findings, labels, comments, grace period, cleanup, and expiry. |
| Issue linking | `scripts/pr-issue-link.mjs` | Parse and normalize only `## Related issue`. |
| Event orchestration | `workflows/pr-policy.yml`, `workflows/pr-policy-reconcile.yml` | Route every PR event and audit through one concurrency group and one reconciler. |
| Scope labels | `labeler.yml`, `workflows/pr-scope.yml` | Derive configured `scope:*` labels from changed paths. |
| Code checks | `workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/select-ci-scope.mjs` | Keep `Static checks`/`Tests`. Selector skip/affected fail open; no workflow `paths`. Only main writes the pnpm store cache. |
| Codex review | root `AGENTS.md` `## Code Review Rules`, `codex-review.md` | Report only P0/P1, security first; 👍 when the linked Issue is solved. |

Do not duplicate a rule across these layers. Changes to required PR template
headings must update the checker in the same commit and validate representative
complete and rejected bodies locally.

Workflow-file security constraints live in
[`workflow-security.md`](workflow-security.md) and bind every change under
`workflows/`.

## Contribution contract

- One-shot identity: Lody team if the user says so, or GitHub login is
  `zxch3n`, `Leeeon233`, or `wibus-wee` (`gh api user --jq .login`, or git
  `user.name` Zixuan Chen, Leon Zhao, or Wibus Wu). Otherwise community; do
  not keep checking. Same-repository branches stay `internal` regardless of
  login.
- Community PRs stay under 1000 changed lines (additions + deletions) unless a
  maintainer assigned the linked Issue to the author. Larger work: file an
  Issue with analysis and wait to be assigned; do not open the PR. Maintainers
  review small focused changes; large unsolicited patches hide invariant breaks.
  Humans: `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Draft every PR from `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`; complex changes use `$show-me`.
  Validate external bodies with
  `node .github/scripts/check-pr-body.mjs --body-file <file>`.
- An Agent opens every pull request as a draft (`gh pr create --draft`) and then
  tells its user to mark it ready for review once they judge it ready for
  maintainers. An Agent leaves draft state only when its user asks.
- Every fork-based PR references a Lody Issue and retains the complete Context
  handoff block and its markers. Use `Closes #123` when merging the PR should
  close the Issue and `Refs #123` only when it must stay open. A bare `#123` or
  full Lody Issue URL in `## Related issue` defaults to `Closes #123`.
- Before opening a fork-based PR, an Agent asks its user to publish the authoring
  conversation and fills the required `### Shared conversation` status and link
  or reason using the template. Accept public links from any authoring tool.
  Only the user confirms publication; never invent a URL, refusal, or limitation.
  Wait for an answer: silence is not refusal. If the user declines, preserve their
  exact reply in a separate fenced block under `#### Sharing refusal (verbatim)`
  within `### Original user prompt`, retaining the triggering prompt unchanged.
- Context handoff answers are public evidence, not placeholders. Redact only
  private spans in quoted prompts/replies with explicit markers; entirely
  redacted evidence and `N/A` do not satisfy the contract.
- An Agent preparing a fork-based contribution explains that the Context handoff
  is public and an invalid PR closes after the seven-day correction period.
- Same-repository branches do not create or require an Issue solely for intake,
  and their bodies are not subject to the external contribution template.

## PR policy

`pullRequestDisposition` classifies each current PR before any mutation:

| Disposition | Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bot` | Author login ends in `[bot]` | Do not normalize or enforce; clear prior managed state when present. |
| `bypass` | `status:pr-policy-bypass` is present | Do not normalize or enforce; clear prior managed state when present. |
| `internal` | Numeric `head.repo.id` equals `base.repo.id` | Normalize an explicit Issue reference; do not enforce the external template. |
| `external` | Repository ids differ or either id is missing | Normalize an explicit Issue reference, then enforce the complete contribution contract. |

`author_association` never classifies a PR. A fork remains external when its
author is an owner or member. The bypass label is an explicit maintainer action
whose authorization comes from GitHub's label permissions; the workflow does
not infer identity from PR text. Removing the label immediately resumes normal
classification and enforcement.

Re-read PR details through the API before classification. Body, labels,
repository ids, changed-line totals, and open state must come from the same
current response.

Issue normalization is a stateless, idempotent body edit on human PRs targeting
the default branch. It operates only on exact references in
`## Related issue`; never infer an Issue from a title, branch name, another body
section, or a diff. Explicit `Refs` and native closing keywords remain
authoritative. A failed normalization is warning-only and must not hide the
validation result.

External validation has one persistent state flow:

```text
valid <-> status:needs-pr-attention (invalid-since) -> status:pr-policy-expired + closed
```

All template and size findings share the same comment, label, timestamp, and
seven-day correction period. A change over 1000 additions plus deletions
without a maintainer assignment on the linked Issue adds a size-specific
finding; over 200 without its prior Issue reference still does. Neither
creates a second status. A valid edit or a skipped disposition clears managed
enforcement state. An expired external PR is closed again when reopened;
bypass or internal classification clears the expired state instead. Before
closing an overdue PR, the audit must re-read and revalidate the latest PR.

Issue-link normalization and cleanup after a valid or skipped disposition are
best-effort feedback. The current validation result alone decides whether an
event-driven external PR check passes. Creating invalid state and completing
expiry are required reconciliation writes; scheduled and manual audits surface
their failures and perform expiry.

## Other automation

- `notify-desktop-nightly.yml` sends accepted main SHA notifications to the
  designated release-PR maintenance workflow only. OSS pushes must not directly
  authorize a desktop release: the receiving repository requires a merged release PR. It checks
  out no source and receives no installer signing or storage credentials. Destination
  configuration is operator-owned; its GitHub App token is scoped to one configured
  repository with Actions write, and is revoked after the job. That permission can
  control other Actions in the destination, so the App installation itself must be
  limited to the intended repository. This does not publish the local-only desktop.

- Issue Forms cover only components present in the public repository. Keep Bug
  and Feature title prefixes, issue types, and existing labels aligned; route
  product support and security reports out of public issues, and request only
  diagnostics contributors have checked and redacted.
- `scripts/check-issue-body.mjs` mirrors required rendered headings and
  confirmations in both Issue Forms. Non-owner, non-bot issues that bypass or
  remove them receive warning-only `status:needs-issue-body`; regular
  organization members are not exempt. A valid edit clears bot-owned state.
- `labeler.yml` is the source of truth for path-based `scope:*` labels. Overlap
  is intentional when a PR affects multiple product areas.
