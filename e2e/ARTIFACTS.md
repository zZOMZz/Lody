# Verification artifacts

Runtime output is written below ignored `e2e/artifacts/` directories.

| Artifact             | Meaning                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `failure.png`        | Full-window state at the failing step                           |
| `trace.zip`          | Playwright actions, DOM snapshots, network, and screenshots     |
| `failure.webm`       | Daily-only recording retained for a failed scenario             |
| `runtime.json`       | Electron, renderer, process, DOM, and memory snapshot           |
| `console.log`        | Timestamped renderer, Electron main, page, and request failures |
| `cli-backlog.json`   | Bundled CLI output exposed through the production IPC service   |
| `failure-index.json` | Stable scenario id to artifact-directory mapping                |

Daily and pull-request regression trace every scenario with screenshots. After
a journey failure, a separate bounded renderer samples at most 600 ordered
trace frames and encodes a 640px `failure.webm`. Video generation therefore
cannot alter Electron startup or journey timing. Successful scenarios do not
produce videos. The read-only Daily job uploads all evidence as one
suite-qualified Actions artifact.
A separate trusted reconciler validates the failure index and each video, then
attaches up to one independently retryable comment per failed scenario on the
durable Daily failure Issue. Only a successful `full` artifact can resolve that
Issue; a successful `smoke` run does not cover prior P1 failures. Oversized,
missing, symbolic-link, and unexpected-path files are never attached; the
workflow run remains linked for complete trace and log retrieval.
Pull-request failures use the same bounded video contract, but attach to the
matching open PR only while its head still equals the failed workflow head.

Acceptance rounds additionally contain `result.json`, `manifest.json`, and a
successful `checkpoint.png` for every selected scenario. Supplied before/after
JSON and retained-path evidence are copied below `evidence/`. The result is
ready for review only when every declared file exists and is non-empty; the
manifest records byte length and SHA-256. A round directory is immutable: rerun
the command to create a new round instead of editing an existing result.

Scout rounds use `scout/<round-id>/summary.json` as the CI discovery contract:

Load rounds use `load/<round-id>/load-result.json` as a replayable synthetic
baseline. The seed phase owns the isolated profile and creates the persisted
Sessions; the reopen phase launches that profile again and records the user
surface, textless-frame/blank-surface trace, and resource trace. `body-bytes`
is capped at 256 KiB per synthetic response, and the fixture never contains
user or agent transcripts.

```text
scout/<round-id>/
  summary.json
  <journey>/
    scout-result.json
    runtime.json
    console.log
    ablation.json                 # ablation runs only
    trace.zip                     # failure or suspected trend
    failure.png                   # failure only
    heap/*.heapsnapshot           # failure or suspected trend
```

`summary.json` has `schemaVersion: 1`, a unique `roundId`, `createdAt`, run
`options`, per-journey status/metrics, and a top-level `suspectedTrends` array.
Each metric declares whether it is a `post-gc-candidate` or `observational`
signal. Each journey result retains its active and post-cleanup trend summaries;
raw checkpoints remain in `scout-result.json`. Heap snapshots and traces may be
large and are captured only when they add diagnostic value.
