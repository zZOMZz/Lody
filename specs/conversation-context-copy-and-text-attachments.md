# Conversation context copy

Status: draft
Translation: pending

## Scenario

A user wants to continue a conversation with a different Agent, model, machine,
or workspace, including when the source ACP provider cannot fork. Copying a
readable history prefix provides a manual handoff without transferring provider
session state or project files.

## Copy boundary

Every user and assistant message exposes a fork menu with Copy context as Markdown.
Native fork destinations retain their capability and completion restrictions;
copying is independent of those restrictions. Copy includes the selected message
and all preceding history, never subsequent messages. The session menu copies all
history. A missing selected message fails visibly rather than expanding the range.
A generating response is copied as a point-in-time partial response and marked so.

User and assistant prose, code-comment bodies and replies, and visual-annotation
bodies remain complete. References retain their code location or visual target;
standalone user images carry an explicit notice that image bytes are not copied. Existing Markdown export budgets may
reduce tool details, with an explicit notice. Attachment names and image counts
are included with a notice that their bytes are not copied. No file migration,
provider state transfer, or automatic target-session creation is implied.

## Interaction

Desktop user-message fork buttons follow the neighboring copy/pin controls: reveal
on message hover or keyboard focus, and stay visible while their menu is open.
Touch layouts retain visible actions. A streaming assistant reply exposes context
copy as a direct Copy action; it must not show a Fork affordance or Fork loading
state until the reply is finished. Finished assistant fork buttons leave space
before the timestamp. Sender names inherit the timestamp color.

Pasting and submission retain their existing behavior for ordinary and folded
text. A paste above 500 KiB is automatically captured as a non-editable
`text/plain` attachment named `pasted-text.txt`, using the existing attachment
draft and send path. Editable text attachments and send-time upload feedback are
excluded.

## Acceptance

- Copy includes the selected message and excludes later history.
- Unsupported native-fork providers and streaming replies can still copy context.
- Streaming copies carry an incomplete-response marker.
- Native fork destinations retain their existing capability/completion gates.
- Assistant Fork affordances and their loading state appear only on finished replies.
