# Shared UI primitives

Status: draft
Translation: pending

## Scenario

A person should encounter the same control language across Lody's desktop and
web surfaces. Buttons with the same role should share appearance, state feedback,
and theme behavior even when they are composed by different product features.

## Responsibilities

`@lody/ui` owns reusable visual primitives and semantic design tokens. A primitive
exposes named product choices instead of asking each caller to assemble its
colors, dimensions, radius, shadow, and interaction states.

The Button supports primary, secondary, ghost, destructive, and link variants;
mini, small, medium, and large sizes; icon-only controls; destructive tone; and
default or pill shapes. These choices define the redesigned interface. Migrated
callers must not reproduce the appearance of the deleted Button implementation.
Buttons that are one control — a command with its options, or a short run of
peers — form a button group: its buttons become segments of one shape with a
seam between them, so a split action never reads as two unrelated buttons
placed side by side.

A field is a composition rather than a single control. A field root owns the
control's name, whether it is disabled, and whether it is valid; the label, the
control, the help text, and the error message read that state from the root
instead of receiving their own copies of it. A caller therefore states a field is
invalid in one place, and cannot leave a control and its message disagreeing.
The composition provides a text input in small, medium, and large sizes, a
multi-line control, a checkbox, a group of radio options, and a switch, and
associates the label with the control without the caller naming an identifier.

The composition also provides a control that picks one value from a list the
person opens, and one that filters that list as they type. These are two parts:
the control a person sees at rest sits with the rest of the family and answers to
the field root the same way, and the list it opens is a floating surface with its
own appearance. A person reaches the list with the keyboard, walks it with the
arrow keys, and takes a row with Enter; the row that holds the value is marked so
they can see which one it is, and the row they are on is marked separately,
because those are two different facts. A list that is open reports what it is to
a screen reader, and a control tells one which list it opens.

The composition also provides a control for a number and a control for a
password. A number is a range rather than a text control that happens to hold
digits: the control owns the smallest and largest values it will take and the
step it moves in, keeps what a person enters inside that range, and reports the
number itself rather than the text of it, so a surface neither parses what was
typed nor writes its own limit. A person moves the value with the keyboard, and
where it is worth nudging, with a control at each end of the field; those two
controls are outside the keyboard's path, because the arrow keys already do
what they do, and each is named in the language the surface is running in. A
number that is outside its range says so to a screen reader and not only
through its appearance.

A password is masked until the person asks to see it, and the control that
reveals it shares one field with the value rather than standing beside it as a
second control: focus belongs to the field, not to one half of it. Whether the
password is showing belongs to the control and lasts as long as the person is
looking at it; no surface can set it, store it, or restore it. The reveal is
named in both of its states — what it will do next, not what the field is doing
— and a field that is disabled disables the reveal with the value, so nothing
in it looks usable when it is not.

A surface that owns a modal states where the popups inside it belong. A modal
holds the keyboard and the scroll inside its panel, so a list that opens outside
that panel is unreachable in it; the surface names the panel once and the lists
under it follow. Product surfaces do not otherwise place these lists.

The same floating surface also carries commands. A person reaches a menu three
ways — a control that opens one, a right click or long press over a region, and
a bar of names along the top of a window — and meets the same commands whichever
way they came: one row, one height, one mark for where the keyboard is. A menu
holds commands, commands that toggle a setting, commands that pick one of a set,
headings over groups of them, and commands that open a further menu; a command
may carry a glyph, a keyboard shortcut, and the fact that it destroys something,
which it states in its own colour rather than only in its words. A command that
toggles a setting leaves the menu open so a second can be toggled; a command that
acts closes it. A person walks a menu with the arrow keys, opens a further menu
from the row that owns it, and leaves with Escape; the row the pointer is on and
the row the keyboard is on are one row, and a row that cannot be used is neither
reached nor run.

The list a control opens is as wide as that control, because the control shows
the value the list holds. A menu is opened by whatever the surface already had
there, so it states a width of its own. Where keyboard focus goes after a menu
closes is a product decision — a surface may want the composer rather than the
control that opened the menu — so the surface states it and the primitive does
not choose for it.

That same floating surface also carries content rather than rows or commands: a
small panel a control opens, with a heading, a sentence about it, and whatever
the surface puts under them. It is one surface with three things on it rather
than three surfaces, so a panel and the menu beside it cannot open at two radii
over two shadows. What it holds is prose, so its text follows the prose rule
rather than the rule a row's label follows.

The same panel can also be offered to a resting pointer: facts about the thing
under it — where a conversation runs, its branch, its pull request — shown
without a press. It is that panel rather than a fourth floating material, so it
lifts on the same shadow and draws no line around itself. It takes no focus and
is not announced as a dialog, since a pointer sweeping down a list passes over
it on the way somewhere else; a surface that shows one card per row decides for
itself how long a pointer must rest and how many cards may be open at once.

A surface that must be answered before a person carries on is a panel over the
whole window, with the page receding behind it. There are three, and they are
one thing arriving three ways: one a person may dismiss, and which shows that it
can be; one that must be answered, where a press beside it is not an answer,
although the key that cancels still is; and one that arrives from an edge of the
window rather than its middle. All three share one appearance, so a padding or a
heading has one place to change. Each states its own panel as the place the
lists and menus inside it belong, so a surface that opens one never has to.
Which answer in such a panel is the affirmative one, and what it is about, is
the surface's decision rather than the panel's.

The one that arrives from an edge can also be sent back to it. A panel sliding in
from an edge promises that gesture, and a person using a touch screen will make
it, so that panel is a different thing from the one in the middle rather than the
same thing repositioned: it is laid out against the edge it belongs to instead of
placing itself, which is what leaves it free to follow a finger. It names that
edge in reading order rather than as left or right, and the direction that sends
it away follows from the edge, so a panel on the leading side departs the way
"away" means in the reader's language. It either meets the window — reaching the
physical edge, squaring the corners that touch it, and keeping its own contents
clear of whatever the device intrudes — or floats clear of every edge as an
object resting over the page. As it is dragged away the page behind it returns in
proportion, so a gesture half-made reads as one that can be abandoned. A shell
that wants the page itself to recede while such a panel is open says so around
its own interface; the panel does not reach out and do it.

A person may also be told what a control is without acting on it. That label is
not a surface a person visits, but it floats like one: it is drawn in the same
material as the other floating surfaces, so it is light in a light palette and
dark in a dark one and never inverts against the surface under it, including
under a palette a surface forced. It never takes the pointer, and it sits above
every other floating thing because what it names may itself be on one. It is
offered to sighted people using a pointer or a keyboard and reaches neither
touch nor a screen reader, so it never carries a control's name — every control
it describes states its own name, and a surface that groups several of them lets
the second appear without the wait the first had.

A surface may also show one thing out of several, and there are three ways it
does so: the choices side by side with the thing under them, the choices stacked
with the thing opening in place beneath the one chosen, and a single such thing
on its own. These are one family rather than three components, because each is a
control that says what is shown and a region that shows it; only the arrangement
differs. None of them holds a value — what they pick is what a person sees, not
what is stored — so none takes a name, a validity or a field around it.

The strip of choices is a sunken track with the chosen one raised out of it, and
that mark is one thing that moves between the choices rather than a light that
turns on under each, because the strip is a single control. It is provided by
the strip itself rather than assembled by a surface. The choices are stated
once at a size, and a strip told to take the width it is offered divides that
width between them. Moving along the strip with the keyboard does not take a
choice, because what a choice reveals may be expensive to produce; a surface
whose regions are cheap may ask for the opposite.

A stacked choice is a row with no fill of its own, separated from the next by
the line the system gives a list, and it says what it hides with a mark that
turns over as it opens. One is open at a time unless the surface says otherwise.
A lone one has no list around it, so it has neither that line nor that row: it
is opened by whatever the surface already had there. What opens is animated from
its own measured height, so what it holds keeps its spacing on something inside
it rather than on the part being measured.

A person may also leave a control pressed. That is not the control that stores a
value in a form — the one with a name, a place in a field and the ability to be
wrong — but a statement that an option is on at this moment: the words in front
of them are bold, the long lines are wrapped, this filter is being applied. It
is a button in every other way, so the keyboard reaches it and a person who
cannot see it is told both what kind of control it is and whether it is on.

What it looks like when it is on follows from where it rests. The system fills a
control with the accent colour when what it holds is stored, and that is right
for the ones whose resting appearance already occupies the sunken place this
system gives to anything you may put something into: on has to be somewhere
else, so it is the accent fill.
A control that rests on nothing has that place free, so it goes down into it and
stays there — which is also what keeps a row of eight of them from reading as
eight of the most important thing on the screen. It goes down and stays rather
than dipping and coming back, which is what this system's raised controls do
when they are pressed.

Several of them may answer to one value, and that is a different thing from the
strip of choices above, not an arrangement of it. The strip picks what a person
sees, so it can be a single control with one mark moving across it; a set of
these stores what is on, and two of its members can be on at once, which no
single moving mark can say. So the set has no track under it and each member
goes down on its own — including when the surface asks for one choice out of
several, because the same set with several allowed has to look like itself. How
tall the members are and what shape they take is stated once, on the set.

A row of controls is itself something the system names, and what it is for is
the keyboard rather than the eye: it draws nothing at all — not even the line a
table is allowed — because it is a row of controls on whatever the surface
already was. A row of eight things a person can press is eight stops on the way
past it unless something says otherwise, so the row is one stop and the arrow
keys walk it, stepping over what cannot be used rather than stopping there. Two
distances say what belongs with what: one between the controls of a cluster, a
wider one between clusters and either side of the line that divides them. That
line is the one line this system allows, turned across the row, and the row
states that rather than the surface — a row laid out one way cannot then be
divided the other.

The system also speaks back. What it says is either what happened or that it is
still working, and those are one family rather than five components. A message
is the same block wherever it appears — a mark that names what kind of message
it is, what happened, a sentence about it, and whatever answers it — and it
appears in two places: kept on the page it is about, or arriving over that page
and leaving on its own. Neither takes the whole window, because a message does
not have to be answered before a person carries on.

A message reports one of four things: something worth knowing, something that
worked, something that may still go wrong, and something that failed. The
palette names three of them; the fourth is deliberately unnamed, because the
colour that would suggest itself is reserved for live state. What it reports
colours its mark and tints the surface under it, and never fills it. The mark
belongs to what is being reported rather than to the surface that reports it, so
a failure cannot be shown with a tick. How urgently a person using a screen
reader is told follows from the same fact: a failure interrupts, a confirmation
waits its turn.

The other half is the wait. A bar shows how far something has got, in the one
colour this system gives to live state; a bar with no value to show is not a bar
at zero but the same bar saying it does not know, which is a different report. A
bar that measures something rather than progressing through it gives that colour
back. A stand-in for content that has not arrived says nothing to a screen
reader, because its shape already says it, and it stops moving where a person
has asked for less movement — while the mark that says work is under way keeps
turning there, since it is the only thing saying the work has not stopped.

Not everything on a surface reports or acts. Three things say what a page is
made of while nothing is happening: a block that groups what belongs together, a
word that states a fact about the thing beside it, and a line between the rows
of a list. Each answers the question this system asks of every part — what its
edge is — differently. The block's edge is the shadow that lifts it off the page.
The word has no edge and no place on the ladder at all: it appears on a page, on
a block, on a row of a list a person has opened and on a panel over the window,
so what it is filled with is a film of its own colour over whatever it happens
to sit on. The line is the edge, and it is the only one the system allows: it
divides rows, never encloses a surface and never underlines a heading, and it
says what it is to a screen reader rather than pretending to be decoration.

A block is a panel one step nearer the page than the one that must be answered,
and it is made of the same parts: a heading, a sentence about it, what a person
came for, and the answers. It does not contain another of itself, and it is not a
control — a surface may say that pressing the block does something, and then the
surface provides what is pressed, because what a press does is the product's
decision and not the block's.

A word that states a fact says what kind of fact twice: by the tint behind it,
and by the colour of the word itself. The colours this system gives to outcomes
are tuned for a mark the size of a glyph rather than for text this small, so a
word does not take one of them as it is — it takes that colour carried half the
way to the colour text is normally written in, which keeps what kind it is while
staying as legible as any other word on the surface. The tint alone is not
enough: a chip this small is a wash a few percent away from whatever it sits on,
and there is a palette in which two of the five outcomes are near enough in
colour that no strength of wash tells them apart, while their words do. A fact
with no kind to state takes the ordinary text colour. It reports the same four
outcomes a message does, and one more — that something is happening now —
because that is live state and the system has a colour for it. It is never a
control: nothing about it answers a pointer or takes focus, and a surface that
needs those needs a button.

Every control in this family shares one set of state appearances: a sunken
resting surface with no border, a placeholder in the hint colour, an accent ring
on focus, a destructive ring while invalid that persists when the control is
focused, and reduced opacity on the whole control when disabled. The states are
defined once for the family, so a control added later inherits them rather than
choosing its own.

A focus ring shows where keyboard navigation is, and only then. A person using a
pointer never sees a ring on a control they did not move to — including the one
a dialog or menu hands focus back to after Escape — while Tab or an arrow key
brings rings back at once. A text field is the exception: whoever is typing sees
which field has the caret, however they got there.

A control that stores a value — a ticked checkbox, the selected radio option, a
switch that is on — shows that as the accent fill, the one hue this system
reserves for state the eye should find, live or stored. A checkbox can also
stand for a partial
selection, which it announces as mixed rather than as ticked. Each of these
controls is a button to the platform: the keyboard reaches it, a screen reader
is told which kind of control it is and whether it holds a value, and a form
receives that value under the name the field root gave it.

A surface may also show records rather than one thing at a time. That is rows
and columns, and it is the one part of this system with no surface of its own:
no fill, no shadow, no rounded edge, because it is rows on whatever the surface
around it already was, and a panel holding one keeps its own edges. The one edge
it draws is the line a list is allowed, between one row and the next; the row of
column names takes it too, because the row after it is the first record, and the
last record draws none.

A column is stated once. What a column is — its name, what it holds for one
record, how much room it takes, whether its values are figures, whether the
records can be ordered by it, what a total under it would say — is one
description, and the row of names and the cells beneath it are two readings of
it rather than two things a surface keeps in step. That is what lets the
composition answer for the rest of a table: it can give a column a width the
surface never writes a cell for, admit across every column at once that there is
nothing to show, and say which column the records are ordered by in one place,
so two columns claiming that at once is not a state that can be described. It
does not reorder the records themselves — a surface that had already ordered
them, on a server or across pages, would be overruled — so what it owns is the
control, the mark of which way round it is, and the one place that fact is
stated for a person who cannot see the mark.

The rows answer the pointer only where pressing one does something, so a table
of facts is read rather than operated; a row that can be pressed is reachable
and usable from the keyboard as well, and says where the keyboard is. Records a
surface would act on together are picked with a control inside the row, which is
both what a person presses and what tells a screen reader what happened, with
the row marked so they can be found again; the control over that column reports
none, some, or all of them without being told which, and picking them all keeps
the records a person took on pages that are not on screen.

A table may be told how tall it is allowed to be, and then the row of column
names stays while the records move under it. That row is no longer a row but a
band over them, so it takes the surface a band over the page takes: without one,
the records are drawn through the names. And a table narrower than its columns
need is not a table with a bar to drag: it is a list of records, each one a
stack of names and values, with each value carrying the name from the row that
is no longer above it. Narrow means the table's own width rather than the
window's, because the same table is narrow in a side panel on a wide screen.

What a list that did not fit offers next belongs with it: a way to the records
that are not on screen. It is one control rather than parts a surface
assembles, because the decision that is easy to get wrong is which pages to
offer out of thousands and where to admit the rest are missing — and it is made
once here. What is offered stays one width from the first page to the last, so
the choices do not move as a person walks through them, and the missing pages
are admitted only where more than one is missing. The page a person is on is
marked twice, once for the people who can see it and once for the people who
cannot. Where there are too many pages to offer at all, it says where they are
instead, and lets them type where they want to be — taking that when they have
finished saying it rather than while they are still typing, since every
half-typed number would otherwise be somewhere the surface had to go. Every
word it says is the surface's, because this package carries no dictionary.

The composition also names two things that are not part of this interface at
all: a person, and a key on their keyboard. A face is shown at one of a fixed
set of sizes, and how large it is decides how large the letters standing in for
it are, so a surface states one fact rather than two that can disagree; a face
is round and a thing that is not a person is not, because a round frame around a
mark that was drawn square is a crop. Whether the picture or the stand-in is on
screen follows from whether the picture arrived, so a surface says what both are
and never says which. A surface that gives the thing a colour of its own — a
colour derived from its name, so the same thing is the same colour wherever it
appears — supplies that colour, because which colour belongs to which name is
the product's decision and not this package's. A face states how much room it
takes and keeps exactly that much, neither growing to fit what is inside it nor
giving room back to a row that ran out.

A key is drawn as the key it is, and the keys of one chord are drawn together
and announced as one gesture. What the key is called is the surface's word,
because which key a person presses depends on their platform and their layout.
It is never a control: nothing about it answers a pointer, takes focus or can be
selected. Where such a key is drawn on a surface whose colours are reversed, it
reverses with it, and the surface tells it so rather than the key guessing.
Neither of these two carries a role in the interface, so neither takes a colour
that names one.

Product surfaces own workflows, placement, responsive layout, and accessibility
requirements. They may add layout or interaction classes when a local constraint
cannot be expressed by the primitive, such as a 44 px touch target in the Mermaid
viewer. Those classes must leave the primitive's visual identity under its props.

## Theme behavior

Semantic StyleX tokens provide light and dark values. A theme applies to a subtree
so a primitive responds without product code selecting raw palette values. Token
names describe meaning and interaction role; component tokens derive from those
semantic values or documented fixed dimensions.

The material is flat with one light above it, in both palettes. A control a
person can press is at least as light as what it rests on and is told apart by a
crisp edge and a short lift, never by a gray fill under a soft cloud of shadow; a
place to put something is recessed; and a raised face may carry a sheen of a few
percent that a press takes away. No surface carries grain, noise, gloss, a
reflection or a deep groove.

A forced theme applies to the subtree it is placed on, including the primitives
inside it. A component token that derives from a semantic colour resolves against
the palette in force on that subtree, not the palette of the document root, so two
palettes can be shown at once on one page.

## Gallery

`@lody/ui` carries a gallery of its own tokens and primitives. It presents each
semantic token, each elevation rung, and each state a primitive exposes through
its props, rendered in both palettes from the tokens themselves rather than from
copied values. The gallery is the reference a person reads when choosing a token
or a prop, and the place a new token or primitive state becomes visible; a token
that no sample presents is a gap the package reports.

## Migration

Primitives move from `@lody/components` one at a time. A legacy primitive is
removed once all in-repository callers use the new package and type checks show no
remaining dependency. The migration does not expose an adapter for old Button
variants or sizes. A primitive arrives with the state appearances its family
already defines; it does not introduce a second colour or state vocabulary for a
state the family has decided.
