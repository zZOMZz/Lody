# ACP capability refresh cache

Status: draft
Translation: current

[中文](acp-capability-refresh-cache.zh.md)

A `machine/acp-capabilities-refresh` request asks a machine what an agent advertises. The
machine used to answer it the only way it could: start the agent, take its `session/new`
response, stop it. On an idle machine that is the most expensive recurring thing Lody does,
and the answer almost never differs from the one already stored.

## What the machine promises

The machine answers from the capability entry it already persisted when, and only when, all of
these hold:

- The entry was produced by a real probe.
- Its `capabilitySourceVersion` is exactly the version the current launch inputs would produce.
  That version identifies the binary: the ACP adapter build, the managed runtime version actually
  installed, a runtime-override path or extension set, and a custom launch command.
- The machine itself recorded that the entry came from exactly the current launch inputs,
  **including the config's environment**. The source version cannot carry this: for custom and
  registry configs, and for every builtin except DeepSeek's endpoint, it does not depend on the
  environment at all, yet a token or endpoint change can change what the agent advertises.

Changing any launch input — binary, override, command, or any environment value — is a miss.

The launch-input record is deliberately kept only in the answering machine's memory. The entry
lives in the Machine Flock document, which syncs to the cloud, and neither an environment value
nor any derivative of one — a hash of a low-entropy token can be recovered by enumeration — may be
written there. The cost is that a machine that restarts cannot attribute an existing entry to its
current inputs, so it probes each config once before trusting the cache again.

An entry the machine cannot key on is never reused. If the expected version depends on work the
machine refuses to do without being asked — a managed runtime that is not installed yet — the
machine probes instead of guessing the version it would install. Entries older than a bounded
lifetime are re-probed, because an agent's slash commands, sub-agents, and model entitlements can
change in the agent's own configuration where Lody cannot see them.

The lifetime is measured from the last time a probe or a created session confirmed the entry,
not from the last time its content changed. Writers still skip rewriting unchanged content, because
every write costs a Flock write, flush and sync, but only while the entry is younger than half its
lifetime; after that an unchanged confirmation renews it. Without renewal an entry whose content
never changes would expire once and then miss on every request that followed.

A cached answer is indistinguishable from a probed one to the caller: it carries the same modes,
models, config options, commands, and capability entry, so a client writes it into its Machine
Flock rows the same way.

## What must still start the agent

Caching is the default path, not the only one. A request may set `force` to require a real probe,
and every request a person or a setup workflow asked for does:

- The Settings refresh a person pressed, which exists because they changed something Lody cannot
  see in the launch inputs.
- The `refresh-capabilities` CLI command, for the same reason.
- Capability verification after authentication succeeds, where the question is whether the new
  credentials actually work and what the account now entitles.
- Onboarding's provider test and provider setup's verification, which exist to prove the runtime
  Lody just installed really starts.

A machine that answers from a cache and a machine that understands `force` are the same machine,
so one negotiated capability covers both: a client sends `force` only to a machine that advertised
`acpCapabilityRefreshCache`, and omits the field entirely otherwise. Omission is the whole
mechanism, not a formality — a machine without the capability parses this request strictly and
would drop or reject one carrying an undeclared field, leaving a forced caller with a timeout
instead of a refresh. A machine that never advertised the capability also has no cache to opt out
of, so omitting the field still gives that caller the probe it asked for.

`force` is likewise absent by default on a machine that does support it, and absence there means
"you may answer from the cache". Both transports carry the field the same way, because the desktop
app and the machine daemon are upgraded separately and either can be the newer one.

## Refreshing is not a schedule

Startup capability discovery is one pass per client, recorded per config rather than per pass, so
a pass interrupted and restarted — losing presence does exactly that — does not re-probe configs
that already answered. Failed configs stay retryable. A client must not turn reconnection into a
recurring probe cycle; nothing in this protocol offers a refresh interval.

## Evidence

`packages/shared/tests/ai-capability-cache.test.ts` (reuse, expiry, unresolved version,
provenance), `packages/shared/tests/local-session-control.test.ts` and
`packages/loro-streams-rpc/tests/machine-rpc-server.test.ts` (the `force` flag on both
transports), `packages/shared/tests/machine-protocol-capabilities.test.ts` and
`packages/loro-streams-rpc/tests/loro-streams-rpc.test.ts` (negotiation: the emitted payload is
validated against a previous-generation schema derived from the current one, on both transports),
`apps/cli/tests/session-execution-service.test.ts` over a real `MachineDocument` (cache hit
starts no agent; override change, expiry, an environment edit, a restart, and `force` all do; an
expired entry re-probed with identical content is served from the cache again; a young one is not
rewritten; no environment value or digest prefix reaches the persisted rows),
`apps/cli/src/lib/loro/machine-document-capabilities.test.ts` (renewal threshold), `apps/cli/tests/agent-setting.test.ts` (the expected version equals
what a launch stamps, and is unavailable while a managed runtime is missing),
`packages/components/tests/startup-acp-capabilities-refresh.test.ts` (an aborted pass does not
re-probe what already answered). Measured behavior before the change is recorded in
`.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-09-16-acp-capability-refresh-cache.md`. Draft for human
review; tests do not grant approval.
